            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Reader</hi> is deſired to take Notice of Two Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this Diſcourſe is not Written by the Direction, Aſſiſtance, or Advice of any Perſon or Party whatſoever; nor with the Privity of any in Authority, but is the meer and only Reſult of the Author's own Thoughts; who makes it his Requeſt, that the Reader wou'd forget that it has an Author, and take it as if it were produc'd by the caſual falling together of the Letters of the Alphabet; it being too common a thing for Men to ſlight Truth, if they approve not of him that utters it; and
<pb facs="tcp:95466:3"/>to indulge Error if recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Author's Name: And yet at the ſame time let the <hi>Reader</hi> be aſſur'd, that the Author is not afraid that the World ſhould know what he earneſtly deſires may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, for the Reaſon afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon divers Paſſages are made uſe of therein, without referring to the Books whence they are taken; there being in ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an Age no great danger of Plageariſm; and in ſo divided and contentious an Age too much danger of the aboveſaid Inconvenience.</p>

                  <p>THE Subſtance of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe was Written above eight Years ſince, and Preſented in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript to Her Late Majeſty, of ever Bleſſed Memory. But Wars abroad, made it unſeaſonable to attempt Peace in the Churches, while the States of <hi>Europe</hi> were ſo hotly engag'd; and had the Church of <hi>England</hi> render'd it ſelf a Pattern of Peace, yet the Nations about us were not at leiſure to obſerve that Pattern.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:95466:4"/>
                  <p>The Divine Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, aſſiſting the Beſt of Kings, hath. Reſtor'd Peace to the Nations of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> among themſelves; And why may not Peace, among the Churches of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> be expected by the ſame Means?</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Deſign of the following Diſcourſe is to attempt it firſt at Home, yet with an Eye to the Peace of the Chriſtian World; I will look back on the Paſt Age, and conſider the Cauſe of our Diviſions, both in Church and State.</p>
                  <p>Two Controverſies have miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably divided this Nation for more than one Century: I mean the Controverſie between the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the King, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between a Strict <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in Matters of Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:95466:4"/>and a Lawleſs Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And our Enemies of the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> have ever ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly kept alive both theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, in order to reduce us to our former Bondage to <hi>Rome.</hi> They took the ſide of Prerogative, and Strict Conformity, till they had ſet theſe Kingdoms in a flame, and broke in pieces the <hi>Engliſh Government,</hi> both in Church and State. They us'd the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Loyalty, to Murder the Poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, to drive many excellent Men out of the Church. And when they had ruin'd Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and the Engliſh Church, by appearing for them; They then fell in for <hi>Anarchy</hi> in the State, and an extravagant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience in the Church, and broke us into Numberleſs
<pb facs="tcp:95466:5"/>Parties and Sects: And while their Emiſſaries wrought dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to build a ſort of <hi>Babel</hi> among us, they caſt the Reproach thereof on the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, when the Nation grew weary of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> of changing Governments every Moon, and ſpringing new Churches almost as often, and found a neceſſity of Reſtoring the <hi>Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> they returned to their old Methods of ſtraining the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and deſtroying both our Civil and Religious Liberties by Arbitrary Power; and on that ſide of the Controverſie they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the late Happy Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. They knew (though we were forbid to ſay) that both the late Kings were in their Intereſt; and that the Prerogative would be certainly on their ſide, that
<pb facs="tcp:95466:5"/>the Diſpenſing Power render'd all Laws already made againſt them uſeleſs, and would conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Popery by our Celebrated <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta:</hi> They knew that Model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Corporations wou'd deſtroy Legiſlation for the time to come, by making <hi>Parliaments</hi> like thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> Tools and Vaſſals to the Crown, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Thus Humane Wiſdom ſeem'd to Promiſe them all Imaginable Succeſs; for the Church-Party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecur'd by the Doctrines of <hi>Paſſive-Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> miſunderſtood; the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Careſs'd with an Illegal Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> among us <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to deſtroy us; we were like <hi>Iſaac</hi> bound; and laid on the Altar, had not our good Angel, in the very Act of Sacrificing, ſtaid the Knife.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:95466:6"/>
                  <p>I do but touch theſe things as being Foreign to the Deſign of the Following Diſcourſe, yet I can't paſs them without obſerving that Solid and Laſting Settlement both of Religion and Civil Liberty, which we owe to His Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Two things the Nation had learn'd by ſad Experience.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>1. By the Confuſions and Diſtractions of the late Times, they learn'd that a Common-Wealth would never do in</hi> England; <hi>for though for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Government made a Figure in the World, it ſoon dwindled into a ſingle Perſon under another Name, and at his Death conſum'd away in Anarchy.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95466:6"/>
                     <item>
                        <hi>2. By the late Reigns the Nation had learn'd that Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power would never do in</hi> England, <hi>though affected and attempted with all poſſible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in both thoſe Reigns.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>What then could Humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom think fit to be done upon the Late Revolution, but to ſettle and eſtabliſh the Engliſh Government on its Ancient and Solid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
                  <p>The moſt Renowned Politician obſerves, <hi>That thoſe Kingdoms and Governments ſtand longeſt that are oft renewed, and brought back to their firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings.</hi> And though in the laſt Age, we could not attain it, we are now blest with the Old. Engliſh Constitution. The Engliſh
<pb facs="tcp:95466:7"/>Government exceeds all others in the World, being a just Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Three Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Monarchy, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy;</hi> and <hi>Democracy: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> justly boasts its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> its Grandeur, and <hi>Democracy</hi> its Liberty: Now the Engliſh Government has all the Advantages of theſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of any; it has <hi>Monarchy</hi> without Arbitrary Power; <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy</hi> without Faction; and <hi>Democracy</hi> without Anarchy; and hence we are blest with <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Just Prerogative is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, the Invaded Liberties of the Kingdom are reſtor'd, and the Incroachments of the Late Reigns condemn'd by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: So that there is an end
<pb facs="tcp:95466:7"/>of the Controverſie between the Prerogative of the King, and the Liberty of the Subject; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the most incurable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity can be Proof against that Evidence of His Majesty's Love to the <hi>Engliſh Liberty,</hi> which He hath given by permitting an Election for Parliament, during his Abſence: and paſſing the Bill for Disbanding the Army.</p>
                  <p>The Controverſie between a ſtrict Settlement, and a Boundleſs Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in Matters of Religion, is alſo in ſome good meaſure compromiſed; we have now no <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition</hi> to force Mens Faith and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences into the ſame Mould, which is just as reaſonable as to make an <hi>Engine</hi> to draw Mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into the ſame Dimenſions. We have no wild Liberty for <hi>Adamites</hi> to run about the Streets, or <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> to disturb us in
<pb facs="tcp:95466:8"/>the time of Divine Service; but the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſecur'd in its <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhments;</hi> and a Liberty to Diſſenters has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sanction of a Law.</p>
                  <p>Now that Maxim, <hi>Salus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli ſuprema lex eſt,</hi> appears in its Beauty, being writ upon all the Actions of our King, and not us'd by the <hi>People,</hi> in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>Now the other Maxim, <hi>Bono principi inſervire eſt optima libertas,</hi> is rightly applied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing writ upon the Actions of the <hi>People,</hi> both in, and out of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and not us'd by the King to enſlave his <hi>People.</hi> The Courage and Conduct of our King, and the Wealth and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the <hi>People,</hi> have once more made <hi>Great Britain</hi> a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb facs="tcp:95466:8"/>Nation, and the Arbiter of the Fate of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Glory of His Majesty in procuring the late ſtupendious <hi>Peace,</hi> and restoring to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours their Raviſh'd Liberties, is as much greater than that of <hi>Alexander, Pompey, Caeſar,</hi> or of any other of the Fam'd Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, as 'tis more Glorious to hinder the World from being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, than to Conquer the World, to ſave Mens Lives than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them. And what was ſaid of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who Restor'd Liberty to the Conquer'd Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> is more Emphatically true concerning His Majesty, and his Loyal Subjects; <hi>That at laſt there are a Prince and a People in the World, born for the Safety of all others, that croſt
<pb facs="tcp:95466:9"/>Seas, and made Wars, at their own Coſts and Peril, to relieve the Oppreſſed, to eſtabliſh Laws, and cauſe them to be obſerved, and to maintain the Publick Security throughout the whole Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is a Subject fit to fill a Volumn, and not to be cram'd into a <hi>Parentheſis</hi> in a <hi>Preface,</hi> and therefore I must hasten to what I principally intended.</p>
                  <p>And notwithstanding Matters in the State are ſo happily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed, and Perſecution ceaſes to be the Reproach of the Church, yet we are still on very ill Terms among our ſelves in Matters of Religion; and to make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe more intelligible, as well as the Deſign of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> I must a little conſider
<pb facs="tcp:95466:9"/>the Grounds and Cauſes of our Diviſions.</p>
                  <p>When by the Divine Mercy we had eſcapt out of the <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> became the <hi>National Religion</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was lamentably viſible, not only in the <hi>Laity,</hi> but <hi>Clergy;</hi> and whoever looks over the Liſts of the <hi>Indocti, Mediocriter Docti, &amp; Docti,</hi> into which Claſſes the Clergy were divided, will plainly ſee the Neceſſity of the <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> ſo much complain'd of.</p>
                  <p>And as the Clergy's Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made theſe things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo the <hi>Firſt Reformers</hi> thought it their Wiſdom to make the Tranſition from <hi>Popery</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:95466:10"/>
                     <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable as might be; for this reaſon while they took away other Parts of the Clergy's Habits, they left the <hi>Surplice,</hi> that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not miſs the other Trinkets; while they took away <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> they left the <hi>Poſture</hi> of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> which was much more ſenſible than the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> while they took away the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> they nevertheleſs continued it at <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;</hi> though they threw off the <hi>Latin Service,</hi> they kept a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> while they Renounc'd the Authority of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> they never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs continued the ſame <hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in the ſame <hi>Provinces</hi> and <hi>Sees.</hi> This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct they hop'd, wou'd have brought the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to Church,
<pb facs="tcp:95466:10"/>and it had that effect for ſome time; but after that the <hi>Engliſh Refugees,</hi> who went hence in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from among the Learned and Pious <hi>Reformers</hi> abroad, who had gone quite through the Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> perhaps a Step too far, the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> fell into two Parties, one Party were for finding out <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> and bringing the <hi>Pope</hi> to Terms: The other Party were for Accommodating Matters, and Forming an <hi>Union</hi> between the <hi>Engliſh Church,</hi> and Foreign <hi>Proteſtant Churches;</hi> but there having been much fewer <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> found among the <hi>Clergy,</hi> upon the Change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion made by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in Subſtantials, than that made
<pb facs="tcp:95466:11"/>by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second in Circumſtantials, the Party which inclined to <hi>Rome</hi> were much the ſtronger, and moſt prevalent at Court. And although the State of <hi>Rome</hi> was generally oppoſed, yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was much hanker'd after; though moſt were againſt the <hi>Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> yet many were for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be <hi>Principium Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis:</hi> On the other ſide, the moſt Learned and Pious of the Clergy were for the other <hi>Union.</hi> Accordingly thoſe that enclin'd towards <hi>Rome,</hi> were extreamly fond of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that their Coalition with the <hi>Holy See</hi> might be the more eaſie: From uſing the <hi>Croſs</hi> at <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> they might eaſily proceed to its farther uſe; from <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> they might take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb facs="tcp:95466:11"/>of <hi>Believing Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> or letting it alone; that they might eaſily ſlip on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more upon the <hi>Surplice,</hi> they had hopes to prevail with <hi>Rome</hi> to allow the <hi>Liturgy</hi> in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and while they kept up the Difference of Order, between <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> they were capable not only of arriving at the <hi>Lordſhip</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and at the <hi>Grace</hi> of an <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> but (upon the <hi>Coalition</hi>) had a Proſpect of the <hi>Eminency</hi> of a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of a <hi>Pope:</hi> They were for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sports</hi> on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and for <hi>Holidays,</hi> and a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> that Men might wear Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teely; for <hi>Singing Prayers,</hi> which makes little difference between <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in Point of <hi>Edification,</hi> eſpecially in that
<pb facs="tcp:95466:12"/>Time when very few cou'd read. They were fond of <hi>God-fathers,</hi> and <hi>God-mothers, Bowing</hi> at the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to the <hi>Altar,</hi> and ſetting the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table</hi> Altar-wiſe. On the other ſide, the Pious <hi>Puritan Biſhops,</hi> were for <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> abroad, who ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled moſt of theſe things, and were for that Reaſon for taking theſe things away, or at leaſt for leaving them indifferent: They were indeed for the pure Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Epiſcopacy, and I conceive, had they ſeen the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, would generally have Subſcribed thereto. And this is in Truth the Reaſon that ſo many are to this Day ſo extreamly fond of things which they themſelves account to be indifferent in their own Nature, and which others
<pb facs="tcp:95466:12"/>take to be ſinful: The <hi>Grotian</hi> and <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> Deſign was the good work in hand, ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and his Adherents and Followers; and Oppos'd by the Arch-biſhops <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Uſher,</hi> the Biſhops <hi>Hall, Davenant,</hi> and others. And this is the true Difference between the <hi>High Church</hi> and <hi>Low Church</hi> (as they are called) to this Day.</p>
                  <p>And here I cann't, without great and pungent ſorrow, lament the Miſery of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for almoſt a whole <hi>Century:</hi> By this Means, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion</hi> (which lies in thoſe things wherein both ſides agree) and even <hi>Morality</hi> it ſelf hath been little regarded, and Mens Zeal for the moſt part
<pb facs="tcp:95466:13"/>hath been imployed in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. <hi>'Tis better to be</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists <hi>than</hi> Presbyterians: <hi>Put the Laws in Execution againſt Diſſenters;</hi> was the Cry on the one ſide, and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> oft in fits dragg'd to the <hi>Court Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> and a <hi>Lay-Chancellor</hi> having ſaid, <hi>I Admoniſh you, I Admoniſh you, I Admoniſh you,</hi> away they were ſent to the Devil. On the other ſide, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> was aggravated to the utmoſt, and condemned as <hi>Anti-Chriſtian:</hi> Some have run from the noiſe of a <hi>Reader</hi> in the Church, ſaying, <hi>They heard the Devil.</hi> And others refus'd to hear a Reverend Devine in a <hi>Meeting-Houſe,</hi> becauſe he had by Licenſe preach'd in a Church. I confeſs, ſuch Follies were not common, I mention them as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
<pb facs="tcp:95466:13"/>Effects of Controverſies about <hi>Indifferent Things,</hi> but yet by <hi>Perſecution</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Exaſperation</hi> on the other, both ſides did generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part <hi>from the true Spirit of Chriſtianity:</hi> And if the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Diſcourſes on both ſides be well conſidered, and an <hi>Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Inquiſitor</hi> were in ſearch for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by our Saviour's Character, <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples,</hi>

                  <p>NO Arguments againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> have been Improved with equal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, to thoſe which are drawn from the Unity of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and the Innumerable Diviſions among <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and although each Point in Controverſie between us and <hi>Rome</hi>

'Tis true, that there is no Argument in Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooning, and I hope it will appear in a ſhort time, that there is as little in the other Topick; yet the ſame Men who ſcarce know how to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Senſes to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> are by thoſe very Senſes induced to <hi>Popery,</hi> while they ſee <hi>Diviſions,</hi> or feel <hi>Dragooning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt of theſe Popiſh Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not to be Confuted by a Pen in its Practice, and needs no Confutation in the Theory; being not Defenſible otherwiſe than by main force.</p>
                  <p>But the former requires moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration, not ſo much to evince that nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from thoſe Diviſions againſt the Truth of <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as

And although ſince His Majeſtys hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Acceſſion to the Throne, His Pious and Princely Care of the

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95466:20"/>Men in <hi>England,</hi> in which the Pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments duly Miniſtred, according to Chriſt's Ordinance, in all thoſe things that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity are requiſite to the ſame: And if this Deſcription be allowed, 'tis impoſſible to exclude the <hi>Presbyterian, Independant,</hi> and <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> Churches, from being Part of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Of the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> may be the greateſt doubt, becauſe they deny <hi>Infants</hi> to be capable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptiſm; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that Error excludes them not out of this Deſcription; for to the Subjects they allow to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of which their whole Communion conſiſts, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are duly Adminiſtred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt's Ordinance, in all thoſe things that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame. It is therefore a wonderful thing to hear Men on one ſide loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, in the Preſence of God
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95466:20"/>and the Congregation, That they <hi>Believe the Holy Catholick Church;</hi> and yet calling their Brethren that go under thoſe ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, <hi>Phanaticks, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> and other odious Names, and Excommunicating them out of the Church. And it is no leſs wonderful on the other ſide, to hear ſome under thoſe ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, accuſing thoſe that conform to the Eſtabliſht Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with Antichriſtianiſm, and denying the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be a True Church, when they themſelves have Subſcribed to that very Article, and Five or Six and Thirty more of their Thirty Nine, and are really Part of the ſame Church. And this one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration Juſtifies the Practice of thoſe who condemn the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of unneceſſary things, by Communicating with the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diſſenters, and condemn the Separating, Cenſorious, and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Humour, wherever ſound
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95466:21"/>amongſt the Diſſenters, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the Conformable Part of the Church. And indeed, it ſeems to be little conſidered by the Generality of Proteſtants, how great the Agreement is between all the ſaid Parties: They have the ſame Rules of Faith, Manners and Devotion; for they own the ſame Scripture to be of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and a perfect Rule of Faith and Life; the ſame <hi>Creeds</hi> are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by them all; the ſame <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> are acknowledged by them all, as the Divine Law; and they agree to our Saviours Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereof, and to all the Precepts, and the Ordinances, and Sacraments of the <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> they have the ſame Object of Worſhip, the ſame Mediator, the Inſpiration of the ſame Holy Spirit; they have the ſame Objects of their Hopes and Fears, they fly from the ſame Wrath, and expect the ſame Glory.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95466:21"/>
                  <p>Again, theſe ſeveral Parties do condemn the Twelve new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, all the Idolatries of the Maſs, Image-Worſhip, Praying to Saints and Angels, and for the Dead, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1, 2.</note> with all the Doctrines of Demons invented by the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy of thoſe Lyars, nor do any of them retain any thing ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in Doctrine or Practice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd by the Apoſtacy of the Latter Times.</p>
                  <p>The Diſagreement among them lies only about Impoſing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Circumſtances of Worſhip, Obſervation of Days, the Uſe of Habits and Geſtures, of Forms and Ceremonies, and Unſcriptural Forms of Church-Government; and about Subſcriptions, and Oaths, and Laws made to enforce Mens own Inventions: All which I ſhall briefly touch, when I have in the following Propoſitions,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95466:22"/>endeavour'd to ſhew what are the true Terms of Union for the whole Chriſtian World; and how all the above-mention'd Parties may enjoy this their Unity in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When our Saviour condemn'd the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Divorce, he grounded his Sentence upon this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>From the Beginning it was not ſo;</hi> and to diſcover the true Terms of Chriſtian Unity, we muſt look back to the Riſe of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CHRISTIANITY</hi> came into this World <hi>Pure and Free,</hi> without the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Yoak of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Elements, without the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Niceties of painful Rights and Ceremonies. It taught to Worſhip God in Spirit and Truth; bound Men to no City or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; preſcribed no Poſtures, nor Dreſſes; it threw down all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, and was a Goſpel ſit to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95466:22"/>be Preach'd to every Creature: Our Saviour taught in Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and in Mountains; and in a Coat woven from the top throughout. The Apoſtles wore the Habits of the Places where they dwelt, and taught in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues that were built: Both Chriſt and they uſed the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint</hi> Tranſlation, and complied with the Cuſtoms and Hours of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And in ſhort, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Rule was to become all Things to all Men,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.22.</note> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the innocent Uſages of all Places; but when thoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, or Uſages,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.3, 4, 5. Gal. 5.1, 2.</note> were added to Chriſtianity, or impos'd, they always rejected them with Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>Thus were Matters left by the Apoſtles, and the Diſciples of the Firſt Age followed their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and hence the Chriſtians among the <hi>Jews,</hi> complying with their Cuſtoms, and the Chriſtians
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95466:23"/>among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with theirs, the Chriſtian World might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one Age, be diſtinguiſh'd into the <hi>Judaizing</hi> and <hi>Gentilizing</hi> Chriſtians. <hi>Paul</hi> Circumciſed <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> among the <hi>Jews:</hi> And Church-Hiſtory tells us, That Fifteen <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Biſhops were Circumciſed; And the Empire of <hi>Habbaſia,</hi> which was Diſcipled by the <hi>Aethiopean</hi> Eunuch, a Jewiſh Proſelyte, continue Circumciſion to this Day, (though as no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rite.) On the other ſide, the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians, and others among the Heathens, uſed ſeveral of their Cuſtoms, by that General Rule, of <hi>becoming all Things to all Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as in the Apoſtles Time, ſome uſed their Liberty for an Occaſion to the Fleſh, and this Charitable Principle occaſioned Differences among the Apoſtles themſelves; (for <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood <hi>Peter</hi> to the Face at <hi>Antioch,</hi> for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95466:23"/>withdrawing from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>Jews</hi>) ſo in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.11, 12.</note> when the Power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Religion grew more cold; the Cuſtoms which were taken up as convenient, ſuch as keeping Days in compliance with the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and Heatheniſh Feſtivals, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the Clergy by Habits, as both <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens uſed to do their Prieſts, became at laſt to be accounted Sacred; and the Days were taken for Holy Days, and the Clothes for Holy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>But the greateſt Depravation of Chriſtianity, came from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement that was between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in their ſetting up of High-Prieſts: The ſhew of Order, and Unity,<note place="margin">Mark 8.27. Luke 9.18.</note> that appear'd therein, was very tempting. When our Saviour had told <hi>Simon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 16.13. to 24.</note> that he ſhould be call'd <hi>Cephas;</hi> and that the Church ſhould be built on his Confeſſion of Faith; it is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95466:24"/>probable that the Apoſtles began to think of his being the Chief; for the Queſtion was ſoon after ſtarted among them,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.1. Mark 9.33. Luke 9.46. Ibid. <hi>and</hi> Mat. 20.25. Luke 22.25. Mark 20.42. Heb. 7.23, 24.</note> which of them ſhould be greateſt; that is to ſay, the Pope. And had not our Saviour Poſitively and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically reſolved the Queſtion, both on that Occaſion, and in Anſwer to the Ambitious Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> Hierarchical Dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in greater and leſſer Popes might have been thought Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable from the Example of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Hierarchy was of Divine Inſtitution; But that our Saviour is our only High Prieſt, is moſt evident. That by that Rule of his <hi>[It ſhall not be ſo done amongst you,]</hi> he hath taken away all colour of Domination among his Miniſters, on Pretence of his Inſtitution, ſeems a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opinion, for the ſeveral Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts do ſo expreſly agree in that Prohibition, that it is impoſſible to evade it by the common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95466:24"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> That our Saviour there forbids Tyranny and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, but not Superiority, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks not of the Authority exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by Tyrants, but Benefactors.</p>
                  <p>It doth no where appear that the Apoſtles were the Governors of the Seventy, nor is any Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Order to be found in Scripture between Biſhops and Presbyters; for the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Apoſtles and the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appears to be this, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were Perſons choſen to be Witneſſes of all that Jeſus did or taught, and of his Reſurrection and Aſcention; they were of the Family of our Saviour, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his whole Converſation in which Reſpect they neither had nor can have Succeſſors: No more than the Evangeliſts,<note place="margin">☜</note> whom no Man pretends to have had Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as Evangeliſts.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95466:25"/>
                  <p>And it ſeems moſt reaſonable to believe, that whereas Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and others hold, that the Presbyters mention'd <hi>Acts</hi> xx. were alſo Biſhops: So they were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles alſo in the ſenſe of St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, Epiphanius, Theodoret,</hi> and others; and <hi>Luke</hi> x. 1. and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Places, the ſame word is uſed concerning them, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </gap> is derived: And if we ſay that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Biſhops, or Presbyters, and Deacons are Officers of Divine Inſtitution to continue in the Church, ſurely we are right, for ſuch only do we find in Scripture, and of ſuch did the Governors of the Church at <hi>Philippi</hi> conſiſt.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some indeed, in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, are ſaid to have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Apoſtles, but they ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not as <hi>Matthias</hi> did <hi>Judas,</hi> for he ſucceeded him in the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Work of the Apoſtolate,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95466:25"/>and therefore was choſen out of thoſe who had accompanied with the Apoſtles all the Time, that the Lord Jeſus went in and out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, beginning from the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> unto the ſame Day that he was taken up, and was added to them to make twelve Witneſſes of his Reſurrection;<note place="margin">Acts 2.21, 22.</note> but the Nature of the Succeſſion was as Apoſtles, Biſhops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in their ſeveral Sees; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Apoſtles, in the ſtrict Senſe as Apoſtles, were not confin'd to any See, but were Miniſters of the whole Catholick Church, and on whom, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf) was the care of all the Churches; and unleſs it can be made appear that the Apoſtles have ſuch Succeſſors, and alſo ſuch as were Witneſſes of what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did and taught, as <hi>Matthias</hi> was the Apoſtolate, as to ſo much of it muſt be Temporary from the Nature of the thing.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95466:26"/>
                  <p>The Arguments for a Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Order of Biſhops, drawn from the Precedency of <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (who there ſeems to be Superiour to the Apoſtles, tho' he was none of the Twelve) concludes only for a Biſhops Power in his own Church where he is fix'd, but nothing for the Superiority in Order of Biſhops above Presbyters, as of revealed Inſtitution. If <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who tells us that St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con to St. <hi>James,</hi> had told us alſo of his Presbyters of a diſtinct Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, no doubt but his Teſtimony had been concluding; but a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and a Biſhop are all one in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: And although at firſt the Twelve Apoſtles, who had the Infallible Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, did ordain thoſe Preſident Biſhops perhaps then, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterwards they were made by Election. The Epiſtles of St. <hi>John</hi> to the Angels of the Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95466:26"/>of <hi>Aſia,</hi> prove not this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Order, nor any thing more than ſhall be hereafter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in this Diſcourſe. And however the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſtand Irrefragably defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the charge of being Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, I cannot ſee but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Biſhop to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is ſufficient to comply with the full Senſe of thoſe Epiſtles, eſpecially if it be conſider'd that the Biſhops of which he ſpeaks were made ſo by the Apoſtles themſelves, and no doubt were choſen by infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Direction, and muſt therefore deſerve a moſt ſingular Reſpect.</p>
                  <p>But allowing Men to think as they ſee Evidence concerning this Difference of Order, certainly the Practice of the Church may be ſuch as may allow of Different Apprehenſions, without occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either Tyranny or Schiſm, the Method whereof is attempted in this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95466:27"/>
                  <p>However it is plain, that both our Saviour and his Diſciples did wholly reject all Temporal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and applied themſelves entirely to their Spiritual Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations; and that there was no Diſtinction Cauſes into of Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical, and Temporal or Civil in the Chriſtian World for above Three Hundred Years after Chriſt. Indeed, while the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were Heathens, and the Judges too throughout the Empire, the Chriſtians (according to the Advice of St. <hi>Paul</hi>) forbare to go to Law,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.5, 6.</note> and referred all their Differences uſually to the Biſhops or Paſtors of the Congregations, of which they were Members. And when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came to the Empire, his miſtaken Zeal confirm'd the Cuſtom, (though the Apoſtle's Reaſon for it ceaſed:) And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Civil Power ought to have been reaſſum'd by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, and the Clergy eaſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95466:27"/>of Secular Buſineſs, his Edict ſet up the Clergy's Domination; and from Arbitrators they became Judges, and Chriſtian Magiſtrates might not Judge unwilling Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>This Corruption grew ſo faſt,<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 7. cap. 11.</note> that about the Year 430. in the Popedom of <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> did Degenerate from an Eccleſiaſtical, to a Secular Ruling and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And when I conſider, how poſitively that Degeneracy is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by our Saviour,<note place="margin">Matth. 20.26. Luke 22.25. Mark 10.43.</note> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions reprov'd it in his own Diſciples. When I conſider what Miſeries the Clergy Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation has cauſed more than Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years, ſince that Degeneracy; how it has turn'd the Church into a meer Worldly Kingdom, and the Laws thereof into Humane Politicks; I cannot but rejoice, that by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> this Degeneracy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95466:28"/>is or might be cured (were the Laws put in Execution) and the Supremacy reſtor'd to the Civil Power. And whether the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> by this Degeneracy did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence the Apocalyptick Beaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Seat of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 4th Beaſt, and ſo the time of his Reign be expired, may be worth the Conſideration of thoſe that ſtudy the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> But certain it is, that in <hi>England</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, had no allow'd Juriſdiction; but the Conqueror coming in under the Pope's Banner, gave him leave to ſend Legates into <hi>England:</hi> From <hi>William Rufus</hi> he attempted to gain Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> which occaſion'd the Baniſhment of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> during the Reign of that King. Upon <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, he Uſurp'd the Donation of Biſhopricks. On King <hi>Stephen,</hi> Appeals to <hi>Rome.</hi> On <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of Clerks from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95466:28"/>Power. And from King <hi>John</hi> he got the whole Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not trace the Steps, by which the Kingdom recover'd it ſelf out of the Hands of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; but (notwithſtanding the Pope held our Anceſtors Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in Slavery, till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth) many Acts of Parliament were made to uphold and maintain the Sovereignty of the King, the Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Common Law, and the Commonweal, as appears by the Statutes of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third and and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, being Laws of Premunire, and Proviſion, by which the Civil Power was preſerv'd, and the Body ſecured againſt the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous pretended Foreign Head: And upon the whole, the Civil Power of <hi>England</hi> kept it ſelf out of the Hands of the Prieſts in all Matters and Cauſes, except Cauſes
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95466:29"/>Teſtamentary, and of Matrimony, Divorce, Rights of Tythes, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and Obventions; for as the Emperors, out of a Zeal and deſire to Grace and Honour the Biſhops, allow'd them Juriſdiction in Cauſes of Tythes, becauſe they were paid to Prieſts; in Cauſes of Matrimony, becauſe Marriages were Solemniz'd in the Church; in Cauſes Teſtamentary, becauſe Teſtaments were many times made in <hi>Extremis,</hi> when Prieſts were preſent. So the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> before the Reformation, did all along derive Juriſdiction in theſe Cauſes, to the Biſhops, though the Right remain'd in them as the Fountain. But herein <hi>England</hi> hath been more unhappy than the Empire; for whereas the Biſhops, when Chriſtian Emperors granted them this Juriſdiction, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe Cauſes, according to the Imperial Law, as the Civil Magiſtrate did proceed in other Cauſes; our Biſhops introduced
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95466:29"/>the Imperial Law, and (ſince it came into the World) the Canon Law alſo into <hi>England,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured all they could to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Image and Superſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. They call'd their Courts, <hi>Courts Chriſtian,</hi> as if the Civil Courts were but <hi>Courts of Ethnicks,</hi> and their Cauſes <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as if Civil Cauſes were <hi>Carnal:</hi> And yet if an Honeſt Man Examine the Matter, he will probably find as much <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> as in <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> a Crime no more <hi>Spiritual</hi> than <hi>Murder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since the <hi>Reformation</hi> began, the Civil and Pretended Spiritual Authority have been wreſting, and they are not yet fully agreed. It was Enacted by the Statute, 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. That all theſe Spiritual Cauſes ſhould be Judged within the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not elſewhere. By the 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95466:30"/>took upon them (even in thoſe Popiſh Times) to Create new Biſhops, Suffragans, and to appoint their Sees. And this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of Biſhopricks is no new thing, for if you will believe <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſes,</hi> he tells us, (in a Writing which he preſented to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third) That in <hi>Britain</hi> there were in the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> Five Provinces, and accordingly Five Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks; under each of which was Twelve Biſhopricks; ſo there were Threeſcore Biſhopricks at a time, when the Iſland was not wholly Chriſtianized. Nor is the Tranſlation of Sees any Novelty; for in the Year 604, Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> did, for the ſake of <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, procure the Tranſlation of the Archiepiſcopal Seat from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where it remains to this Day, notwithſtanding the endeavour of <hi>Gilbert Folioth,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

                  <p>But (to proceed) by Statute 1. <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. The Writ of <hi>Conge delire</hi> was ouſted, and it was Enacted, That none but the King by his Letters Patents ſhould collate to an Archbiſhoprick, or Biſhoprick; That all Proceſs Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſhould be in the King's Name, and the Teſt in the Name of the Perſon having Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juriſdiction, and the Seal to be the King's Arms. And though this Act was Repealed by the Firſt <hi>Marie, Cap.</hi> 2. yet that Act was Repealed again, by <hi>Primo Jacobi, Cap.</hi> 25. And ſome think that the Statute 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. is revived thereby, and thoſe who are Enemies to the Church, are ready to enquire, What Penalties our Biſhops are liable to, by Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Proceſs in their own Names,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95466:31"/>and uſing their own Seals. For notwithſtanding the <hi>Cant</hi> of <hi>The Church! the Church!</hi> their Courts are the King's Courts, and their Law, the King's Eccleſiaſtical Law; and this is acknowledged by the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and all the Laws made to this purpoſe, are but in Affirmance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law; notwithſtanding the Author of <hi>Vox Cleri,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vox Cleri, <hi>P. 1.</hi>
                     </note> was ſo fond of <hi>Loyalty to the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This indeed was an Expreſſion which explain'd the Carriage of the High, Church-Party to His Preſent Majeſty; for though they talk'd loud in behalf of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, it was only that the Prerogative might pay them Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; and they were willing it ſhould rob the Lay-Subject, if it allow'd them to poſſeſs what they had filch'd from the Crown; The King and Queen muſt firſt Swear Allegiance to the Church,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95466:31"/>before they ſhould be Crown'd; and then they thought they had catched them, and refuſed to Swear Allegiance to them, as the Law requir'd; but if inſtead of that horrible abuſe to which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was expoſed in the Late Reigns, a <hi>Teſt</hi> were Compos'd, renouncing <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth Principles,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to maintain the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> by King, Lords and Commons, as it is now Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; the King and Kingdom would be ſecured, beyond all poſſibility of Danger, and the juſt Rights of the Arch-Biſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and other Clergy, would be maintain'd, though thoſe <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite</hi> Church-Men were ſent out to the <hi>French King,</hi> whom they were not able to bring in to them. And it is obſervable, That as in the Late Reigns, all the Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Hierarchy, ſtrove to prove that it was the Duty of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95466:32"/>
                     <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> to ſubmit to the <hi>Church Eſtabliſh'd by Law,</hi> in thoſe things which they acknowledg'd to be in themſelves unneceſſary Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, becauſe they were impos'd by Authority; but they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left the Government to ſhift for it ſelf, and to Anſwer for thoſe Impoſitions to God, Conſcience, and the World: So now the ſame Party left His Majeſty, and all concern'd in the Late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to Anſwer for it to God, their own Conſciences, and the World; for they waſh'd their Hands, and ſaid, <hi>They were Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of being concern'd therein;</hi> but they were under the force of Providence; and if His Majeſty would uphold the Power of the Church, and take care to ſit faſt, they would pay Him Allegiance; otherwiſe they were ready for the next that came, if he had the good luck to get the better. And this is the Subſtance of the late
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95466:32"/>Writings of that Party. How much better Friends are they to His Majeſty, who believe Him to have an undoubted Right to his Crown, and to Govern the <hi>Church</hi> as well as the <hi>State;</hi> and that they are bound not only not to Reſiſt Him, but to Aſſiſt Him with their Lives and Fortunes, againſt all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> rightly underſtood, is Lovely and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable; but that which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and divided the <hi>Church</hi> is the Jumble and Mixture that hath been made, between the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Power, which is of the Eſſence of his Office as a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Power which he has as Preſident of the Presbytery, and the Power which he has by Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the King. A Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Biſhop (as is clear by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Teſtimonies) had no more under his Charge than he could
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95466:33"/>Perſonally know; and when Churches grew larger than one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop could Perſonally inſpect, they had more Biſhops, yet ſo as that one Biſhop had the Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and in a ſhort Time he only ingroſt the Name, and the others were called <hi>Presbyters;</hi> from among whom, upon the Death of the Biſhop, another was choſen to ſucceed him. But the Truth is, as is moſt evident, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the Teſtimony of that Incomparably Learned, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> That every Presbyter hath a Right of Governing his Church, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring Diſcipline,<note place="margin">Vid. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher's Reduction.</note> and thence hath the Name of <hi>Rector;</hi> and is in the Engliſh Office of <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> commanded to Adminiſter <hi>Diſciplinam Chriſti,</hi> the Diſcipline of Chriſt; and he expreſly avers, That the omiſſion of the Exerciſe thereof in <hi>England,</hi> is only from the Cuſtom receiv'd in <hi>England;</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95466:33"/>and that, that Impediment may be remov'd by Law: So that the Relation a Biſhop hath to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, is no more than as a Presbyter; the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of a Biſhop to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a Dioceſs, is of Pure Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Practice, grounded on the General Rules of doing all in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, though it be no part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Inſtitution: All Societies are taught by the Light of Reaſon to keep ſome Order; and for convenience of Regular Converſe, the Perſon of a certain Number, whom they agree to be Firſt in Honourable Qualities, hath a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right to be Preſident, though ſtill of the ſame Order: Thus the Preſident of a Colledge of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, is no more than a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to his Patients, but he is a Preſident to the other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; and it would be a ſtrange Fancy for ſuch a Preſident to claim a Right of being Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95466:34"/>to all the Bodies in <hi>London,</hi> and alone to adminiſter ſome ſort of Phyſick to all within the <hi>Bills of Mortality;</hi> I doubt ſuch an Uſurpation would increaſe the Number of the dead, and be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon'd horrid Tyranny over the Living.</p>
                  <p>But there is a third, piece of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop, and in that he is plainly the King's Eccleſiaſtical Lord Lieutenant, in ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Ground, call'd a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;</hi> and this he has by poſitive Humane Law; and in this reſpect is not a Church, but a State-Officer, entruſted with part of the Civil Power: His Courts are Civil Courts, and he ſits in the Houſe of Lords, with reſpect to His Temporal Baronage.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſtinction aforeſaid were well underſtood, how eaſie were it to end the Controverſie
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95466:34"/>about the <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S DIVIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M</hi> of <hi>EPISCOPACY,</hi> and the <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S DIVIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M</hi> of <hi>PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERY</hi> and <hi>INDEPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCY;</hi> about the Delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhop's Power to Lay-Chancellors, and the Biſhops Lording it over God's Heritage: And how eaſie would it be to Rectifie abundance of Matters complain'd of in the preſent Practice of the Church? For Example, If the Biſhops were made by the Delivery of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> and <hi>Annulum</hi> by the King,<note place="margin">Staff and Ring.</note> as they were before the Conqueſt, or by Letters Patents; and were he made Preſident of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery by their Election, eſpecially if the King did uſually give the <hi>Staff</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> or grant the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents to the Perſon firſt choſen by the Presbytery; they might with the greater Aſſurance Pray for the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit at his Election. Were
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95466:35"/>his Lay-power underſtood to be Delegated to his Lay-Chancellor, (according to the good Example of <hi>Sylvanus</hi> of old) who would find fault? And the Legiſlators would ſoon think of giving their Courts a Civil Proceſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their horridly abuſed Spiritual Weapon <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Were the Presbyter reſtor'd to his Juſt Right, we might ſoon ſee ſome good Effect of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which can never be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to any purpoſe, till Pariſh-Communion be made more pure, and the Paſtor's Power be reſtor'd. One Phyſician may as well take the Charge of all the Bodies in <hi>London,</hi> as one Biſhop of their Souls; and the Congregations that are gather'd from the ſeveral parts of great Cities, cann't have the perſonal Inſpection, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Acceſs to the Paſtoral Help, nor enjoy the Advantage of that Article of the Creed, <hi>Communion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95466:35"/>of Saints,</hi> which ought to be provided for in a well Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd Church. And this is what my Soul longs for, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope; For he that will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially conſider the late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> particularly thoſe of Doctor <hi>Maurice,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Scot,</hi> and the Writings againſt it, particularly of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clerk ſon,</hi> will, as I conceive, find theſe things true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy, as now Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are wholly dropt in the Scuffle, and no Foundation found for either in Scripture, or Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Independency, if it be meant only of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between a Paſtor and his Flock, and his Independent Right of Exerciſing the Power of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95466:36"/>Keys over them, it is plainly <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> but if taken in a Senſe excluding. National Churches, taking away all the common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Means of Communion among Chriſtian Congregations, and leaving the Power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Admiſſion to the Lord's Supper, in the People, hath as little Foundation in Scripture, or Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Councils are for Advice, not Legiſlation, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, not Domination, and have no Power to make Laws for the Univerſal Church. They can no more Alter, or add to the Laws of Chriſt, than the <hi>Jewiſh Prieſts</hi> could Add to, or Alter the Laws of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And as there never was, ſo there never can be a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council; and that a Viſible Head of the Univerſal Church on Earth, Monarchical or Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, is a meer <hi>Chinera,</hi> never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95466:36"/>by GOD, nor of Uſe to Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Epiſcopacy which within a certain compaſs of Ground, provides a Perſon choſen by the Presbytery, to a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency, to preſide in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> within his Precinct or Dioceſs, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and principally join in the Ordination, and Confirmation of Perſons, who deſire to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lord's Supper; to be adviſed with by every Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within his Precinct, where any Difficulties ariſe concerning the Exerciſe of the Keys; but which deſtroy not the Power of the Presbyter, nor the Primitive Church Species, has good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Scripture, Antiquity, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Nature of the thing; I ſay, choſen by the Presbytery: For even Mr. <hi>Dodwel,</hi> (that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Bigot to Prelacy) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95466:37"/>that Biſhops were firſt made by Election.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Epiſcopacy thus ſtated is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to right Reaſon are <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> (that is to ſay) Reaſon teaches ſuch Things without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; and if Reaſon had not been ſufficient to this End, he that ſpent Fourty Days on Earth after his Reſurrection, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Apoſtles in the Things concerning the Kingdom of God, would not have Omitted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them herein: He that was <hi>faithful only as a ſervant,</hi> gave Rules for every Pin in the Tabernacle;<note place="margin">Hebr. 3.5.</note> and the very Colour of the Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons uſed by the Prieſts. And our Lord, who was Faithful as a Son over his own Houſe, would not have Omitted a Matter of ſuch Importance. So when Chriſt had Inſtituted the Office of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or Biſhops; and the Apoſtle
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95466:37"/>given an Account of, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for their Office, there was no need to Inſtitute the Method of their Concord, which right Reaſon taught Men of all ſorts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Philoſophers, Phyſicians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, Presbytery, if it mean only an Equality of Goſpel Miniſters, by the Inſtitution of Chriſt, it is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as plain as Words can make it; if it be meant, the Form of Government ſo diverſify'd, as is uſually meant by that Word, it is not <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> having no Reveal'd Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And Reaſon taught all the Chriſtian Church to appoint a Preſident Biſhop for Life; and nothing but the Riſe of Popiſh Prelacy could make the other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſeem Reaſonable; and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> himſelf (as I take it) fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, out of Neceſſity, and not out of Choice: But ſurely this Part of Church Government, is no more determin'd by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95466:38"/>than the Form of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> While under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT,</hi> the Clergy encroach on the Prerogative of the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; whether it be in an Epiſcopal or Presbyterian Form, neither God nor His Majeſty will have the Obedience paid them which is due; and the only way to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Government,</hi> is to keep them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſtinct, and unconfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>to give to Caeſar the Things that are Caeſars, and to God the things that are Gods.</hi> To own the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as the Vicegerent of Chriſt, in his Prophetical and Prieſtly, and the Civil Magiſtrate, as his Vicegerent in his Kingly Office. Particularly the Civil Power is to appoint the Bounds of Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks; and ſo is the Twelfth The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that clear headed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95466:38"/>Learn'd Dr. <hi>Iſaac Barrow.</hi> 
                     <q>By the Laws of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Ancient Practice, Princes may Model the Bounds of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, Erect Biſhopricks, Enlarge, Diminiſh, or Transfer them as they pleaſe.</q> Thus he; where by <hi>Princes</hi> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily intends the Legiſlative Power, where-ever 'tis placed, by the Reſpective Conſtitution of Chriſtian Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Were theſe things well conſider'd, the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between the Epiſcopal and Presbyterian, would be certainly reconcil'd, and even the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Antipoedobaptiſt, would probably be folded, if the Terms of Union, which the Church preſcribes, did not keep them out: Which will come next to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, after I have premiſed the few following ſhort Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95466:50"/>on't: Impoſition is warring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Nature of Man: <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency fell by the Breach of a Poſitive Law, concerning a Matter in it ſelf indifferent, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the Sanction of the Law, although it receiv'd the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from GOD Himſelf: And it muſt be highly unreaſonable for Men to expect from fallen Man that Obedience which was not paid by <hi>Adam</hi> to GOD Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, except, at leaſt, their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Command were as Evident as His.</p>
                  <p>The Right Reverend Prelate, Doctor <hi>Jeremy Taylor</hi> tells us, in his Liberty of <hi>Prophecying,</hi> That he that makes an Article of Faith, or a Term of Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without a Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, chalks out a new way to the Devil. The Incomparable <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> and the Excellent <hi>Hale</hi> of <hi>Eaton,</hi> have fix'd the Name
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95466:51"/>of <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> on the Impoſers of unneceſſary things: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he that in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion makes indifferent things neceſſary, Uſurps Power Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, yea, to GOD Himſelf, for they thought fit to leave them indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;<note place="margin">Job 40.12.</note> And ſhall he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth with the Almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Him? If it was not well done, he that reproveth GOD let him anſwer it. As for the Appointing of Churches, and Places, and Times for Aſſembling, and Circumſtances of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon makes ſuch Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments neceſſary, but ſtill without Reſtraint, as to other Places or Times, and ſuch Appointments, fall not under the Notion of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Things.</hi> 'Tis an abſurd way of Arguing, That the Church may command Indifferent Things, becauſe Things Good are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and Evil Forbid by God,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95466:51"/>and they have no other way of Exerting their Power; Would they be Greater, or Wiſer than their Maſter: Our Saviour died to bear witneſs to the Truth, and the ſingle Truth, that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately died to bear witneſs unto was, That He was a King. And I know no Man, or Church, that has any thing to do to mend our Saviour's Inſtitutions: Their Power in Religious Matters is to enforce what He has commanded, and to reſtrain from what he has forbidden, and accordingly to Adminiſter Rewards and Puniſhments. This is Power and Work enough for Souls that are ſincere; and wherever any Power on Earth hath been found making ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, they have alſo been found entirely negligent of what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or forbid by God; and their whole Zeal hath been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, in enforcing their own Innovations: <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as well

                  <head>TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
                  <p>ABout the Year of our Lord <hi>375, Themiſtius</hi> the Philoſopher, who was alſo Conſul at that time, told the Emperor <hi>Valens,</hi> that there were <hi>300</hi> Opinions or Sects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Philoſophers, far more than there were among the Chriſtians, and yet they never Perſecuted one another. This he ſaid to diſpoſe that Emperor, who was a Perſecuting <hi>Arian</hi> to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Orthodox.</p>
                  <p>And ſoon after the Emperor <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> being incens'd by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Flavianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> the good Biſhop thus appli'd to tho Emperor, as 'tis reported by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95466:67"/>Lib. <hi>5.</hi> Cap. <hi>23. O Emperor. if any Man do blame my Faith as perverſe, or my Life as unworthy, I am content to be Judged by my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; but if the Diſputation only be concerning Principality, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Places, I will not contend with any Man, but denude my ſelf of all Superiority, and commit the Chair of</hi> Antiochia <hi>to whom you like beſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had the Spirit of this Philoſopher, and of this Partriarch prevailed in the Chriſtian World, how much Miſchief and Miſery had been prevented, which fill the Hiſtory of all Ages ſince that time.</p>
                  <p>'Tis now more than <hi>20</hi> Years ſince I became moſt deeply affected with the State of Chriſtianity. I oft ſtood in a Melancholly Amazement, that ſince the Bleſſed Jeſus had been in this World,<note place="margin">1 Jo. 3.5.8.</note> to take away Sin, and deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and altho' his Commiſſion to his Apoſtles was to diſciple all Nations,<note place="margin">28. Mat. 19.</note> yet at the diſtance of above
<pb facs="tcp:95466:67"/>
                     <hi>1640</hi> Years, not one fourth part of the World ſhould bear the Chriſtian Name. That deducting from that part, the Churches that lie in groſs Ignorance, or groſs Idolatry, and among the Reform'd Churches the Perſecutors, the openly prophane, the groſly ignorant, ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the Ordinances of Chriſt, who yet will be called Chriſtians, I was tempted to abuſe that Paſſage of the Apoſtle, <hi>2 Gal. 21. Then Chriſt is dead in vain:</hi> But it was not long before I had framed in my Thoughts a more pleaſing Scene of Things, which I fancied <hi>I</hi> ſaw in the Prophetick part of the Scripture, and if <hi>I</hi> be miſtaken, <hi>I</hi> own my ſelf exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholden to the Miſtake, having in the Years that are ſince paſt enjoyed many a comfortable Hour in the proſpect of the approaching Glory of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. Thus when Men in a Storm diſcover a ſafe Harbor, how chearfully do they cry all hands aloft, how dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent is every one to do his utmoſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Port. <hi>I</hi> do not intend to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:95466:68"/>the Reader with any account of my Endeavours to promote what <hi>I</hi> ſo much much deſire, further than is neceſſary to juſtifie, or at leaſt to excuſe ſetting my Name to the following Diſcourſe. <hi>I</hi> have been long perſwaded, that Chriſtianity muſt recover it's Primitive Purity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can obtain its promis'd Peace. <hi>I</hi> don't mean its Primitive Poverty or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, but its Comformity to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are the only Means of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Peace, and its being freed and deliver'd from the Corruptions and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which have been introduced into the Chriſtian Church by Hereticks, by the Ambition and Tyranny of Prieſts, and the Ignorance and Folly of the Laity. At the late Revolution <hi>I</hi> preſumed to preſent to the late Queen of Pious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ſome Thoughts on this Subject in Manuſcript, the Subſtance whereof was afterwards Printed under this Title, <hi>Catholiciſm without Popery,</hi> &amp;c.

But no Man having been ſtirred up to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, and my Practice agreeable to my Principles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rendered me Obnoxious to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Peace, I could no longer forbear to publiſh to the World what I judged neceſſary, at the ſame time to vindicate my own Integrity, and to promote the Intereſts of Genuine Chriſtianity. I need not any other Excuſe, than what I made to the Perſon who preſented that former Diſcourſe to Her late Majeſty.<note place="margin">A Paſſage Recorded by all the Evangeliſts.</note> That it was a Lawyer that took care of the Body of our Bleſſed Saviour,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.57.

                  <p>But alas! what poſſibility is there of Peace, if the Priests continue ſo fond of their reſpective Parties, that they will venture to treſpaſs against their God, against their Sovereign, against Truth, Scripture, Charity and Reaſon to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own Follies: Of which we have a freſh and notable Instance in a late Diſcourſe before the Queen, Entituled, <hi>Of the Imitation of Chriſt,</hi> in which
<pb facs="tcp:95466:69"/>the Author appears to be a Perſon of good Learning, and I hope ſerious Religion, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of good Language, and well read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet has offered that to his Sovereign in the Name of God, and as the Imitation of Chriſt, which is falſe and Unſcriptural, a Notion mention'd by Papiſts, Irrational and uncharitable. The whole Paſſage runs thus.</p>

                     <hi>was to take away the Ceremonial Part of the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>yet as long as it was to laſt, how careful was he to preſerve in it De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Order. How readily, in the mean time, did he comply with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and harmleſs Rites; much more thoſe that were inſtructive and ſignificant? He Celebrated the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover but an hour before the Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted his Holy Supper in its Place: He obſerved all the Feſtivals of the Church, not only thoſe that were of Divine Appointment, but the Feaſt of the Dedication it ſelf, a Feaſt purely of humane Inſtitution, and no older than</hi> Judas Maccabeus. <hi>It was ſufficient
<pb facs="tcp:95466:70"/>to him that it was ordained by the Church of the which he was then a Member, nor did he take upon him to queſtion the Authority in ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a Right. And what he practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, he expreſly commanded his Diſciples to imitate.</hi> The Scribes <hi>and</hi> Phariſees, <hi>ſays he,</hi> ſit in Moſes's Seat, all therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do. <hi>Which by the way, is an unanſwerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the Churches Right in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Matters of Ceremony, and Things indifferent. For ſurely the</hi> Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh <hi>Church was at that time corrupt enough to be denied that Priviledge, If it were ever fit that ſuch a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhould be denied the Church. And if Chriſt thus taught and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed Obedience to a Corrupt Church, what muſt be thought of thoſe who refuſe it to a pure one? If he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Rites, ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo dark and ſo burdenſome, what can they plead in their Excuſe, who
<pb facs="tcp:95466:70"/>diſdain to comply with the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of our Church, ſo few, ſo rational, and ſo diſcreet. They muſt not, they cannot juſtly take it ill to be told that, however they may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they do not abide in Chriſt, becauſe they do not walk as he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The things advanced in theſe words, with which I am ſo free, are theſe. That our Saviour complied with all the Rites of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which he calls indifferent and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. That he obſerv'd a Feſtival of the Churches Inſtitution, <hi>viz.</hi> the Feaſt of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. That he commanded his Diſciples to imitate him therein, and that therefore they who do not comply with the Ceremonies of our Church, do not abide in Chriſt, becauſe they do not walk as he walk'd. Now,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> All this is falſe and Unſcriptural, for he juſtified his Diſciples, not waſhing their Hands before Dinner,<note place="margin">15 Mat. 9.7 Mark 7.9. 11 Luke 38.39.</note> and told the <hi>Jews</hi> that in vain did they worſhip God, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men; many Paſſages of like
<pb facs="tcp:95466:71"/>import are found in the New Teſtament; and ſurely no Rite could be more indifferent, or harmleſs than that. 'Tis alſo falſe that the Feaſt of the Dedication was Ordained by the Church, for the place which he quotes, tells us, that it was Ordained by <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi> and his Brethren, with the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Mac. 4.59.</note> which is rather the State than the Church, and ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Judas</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Command of the Army, that he had the Publick Adminiſtration put into his Hands, and that the People appointed that Anniverſary.

'Tis alſo falſe that he commanded his Diſciples to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in any ſuch matter. The Text quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted muſt be underſtood only of the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> taught by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> for our Saviour elſewhere bids them beware of the Leaven of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees,</hi>

                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> 'Tis irrational, for can any Man in his Wits, that is not ſtrangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Prieſtcraft believe that one great end of our Saviour's coming was to take away the Ceremonial part of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was Inſtituted by God himſelf, even ſo particularly

Suppoſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in our Saviour's Time had made a Canon, that Circumciſion ſhould not admit into the Church, but that after the Child was Circumciſed he muſt be received into the Church by Printing the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil on his Forehead; can any Man believe that our Saviour would have allowed ſuch an Addition to the Divine Inſtitution? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuppoſe that it were clear that our Saviour did obſerve the Feaſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, there is no reaſon for any ſuch Concluſion from ſuch Premiſſes, as this Author draws from them; if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters ſcrupled to obſerve the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the Caſes might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:95466:73"/>paralled; it being an Anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appointed by the State to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate a National Deliverance above <hi>1500</hi> Years after the Eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Religion: But ſuppoſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had beſides the Sabbath, appointed one Day to remember the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Light, another Feaſt to Commemorate the making of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a third to bleſs God for making the Sun and Moon, and a fourth for the Creation of Man, and a fifth for the Creation of <hi>Eve,</hi> a ſixth to remember <hi>Abraham</hi>'s going out of <hi>Ur,</hi> a ſeventh for <hi>Noah</hi>'s going into the Ark, and ſo forth; what can we think our Saviour would have ſaid to ſuch Inſtitutions? Again, whereas at the Inſtitution of the Paſſover,<note place="margin">12 Ex. 11.</note> the People were to eat it with their Loins girt, their Shoes on their Feet, and their Staffs in their Hands; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had made a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that all ſhould kneel when they eat
<pb facs="tcp:95466:74"/>the Paſſover, can we imagine that our Saviour would have approved of ſuch a Canon, altho' it doth not appear, that he took the Poſture to be any neceſſary part of the Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> Surely I need not uſe many words to ſhew that this Cenſure is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when the Papiſts in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion had made the Proteſtants turn Papiſts, they knock'd them on the head, while (as they ſaid) they were in a good Mood, that they might ſend them to Heaven, but this Author turns Men out of Chriſt, and conſequently ſends them to the Devil, tho' they comply with the Goſpel in every thing to be found from the beginning of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> to the end of the Revelations. This is no part of the Imitation of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I think it an exceeding ſtrange effect of Prieſtcraft, that ingenious Men, ſhould be thus groſly miſtaken, but that when they have made whip Syllabub, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſerve them but to preſent it to the Queen, this is rude and ridiculous.
<pb facs="tcp:95466:74"/>I believe in my Conſcience, that Her Majeſty understands and practices true Chriſtianity, and imitates our Saviour acceptably to God, and much better than any one of Mr. <hi>Duke</hi>'s Party; and I do not believe that ſhe is in any danger of being miſled by ſuch Guides. But Her Subjects are not ſo wiſe, and it may make People Surfeit of a Diſh, when they are told that it was at the Queens Table, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when every thing but the Sauce is really excellent. I am abundantly ſatisfied that the true Reaſon that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity has loſt ground in the World, is the Prieſts pretending to be wiſer their the Scriptures would make them. All the Books of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> written in the <hi>2d</hi> Century, are one continued Proof hereof: He charges thoſe against whom he wrote, that they pretended to obſerve more then was commanded, which he Animadverts upon, as preferring their own Diligence to God himſelf. 'Tis with him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Argument, that ſuch things are
<pb facs="tcp:95466:75"/>not in Scriptures, and therefore no part of Revealed Religion. Acoording to their Doctrine (ſays he) <hi>Peter</hi> was imperfect, and ſo were the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and it behoves them to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and become theſe Men's Diſciples; but this (adds he) is ridiculous. And ſays St. <hi>Hierom,</hi>

                  <p>But I muſt not enlarge, at leaſt at this time on this Subject; only having ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to know the Original of the Charter,

                     <q>and a deſire not to keep up, but to reconcile our Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not to promote Parties and Factions, but Peace and Unity, not for the ſake of any private End or Intereſt whatſoever, but for the ſake of Truth, and for the general Good.</q> Thus far therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſelf to be ſuch a Perſon as you wiſh your Anſwerer ſhould be. But becauſe you, and the Writers of your Party have taken the liberty to accuſe <q>Men of my Principles as Hypocrites, as unfit to be Guardians of Children, or Executors of Wills, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with our Principles for the ſake of an Office, as ſetting up an Arbitrary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Power in our own Conſciences, as acting contrary to our Original Principles, as if <hi>Occaſional Conformity</hi> were ſuch an Offence as in inconſiſtent with the Publick Safety, and Occaſional Conformiſts, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſit to be rank'd with Papiſts, Deiſts, and Socinians.</q> I have thought it my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thus to acquaint you, that I have alſo that other Qualification to become your Anſwerer, That "I dare own my Principles.

And the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95466:78"/>Matters in Controverſie ariſing from thoſe Fears, ſeem in a fair way to be determined to the Satisfaction of all Parties by Her Majeſties Gracious Speeches from the Throne, That Her Majeſty will always make it Her particular Care to encourage and maintain the Church, as by Law E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, and to maintain the Act of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration for the eaſe of Diſſenters.</q> Give me leave to add, alaſs, to what end did you erect a Pompous Frontiſpiece before an Epiſtle Dedicatory, a Preface, a Diſcourſe, and a Poſtſcript; and all theſe on a Subject, of which you ſeem to know no more, than if you had lived in <hi>Turky,</hi> or under the <hi>Great Mogul:</hi> I mean the Principles of the Occaſional Conformiſts; for I had rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute your unaccountable Miſtakes concerning them to Ignorance, than Inſincerity.

                  <p>I take leave alſo to inform you, That both theſe ſorts of Occaſional Conformiſts do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Apoſtle's Creed, and particularly the Holy Catholick Church; or, as the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Creed has it, They believe One Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Apoſtolick Church: They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the 19th Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> That the Viſible Church of Chriſt is a Congregation of Faithful Men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly miniſtred, according to Chriſt's Ordinance, in all thoſe things, that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame: That neither ſort of theſe Occaſional Conformiſts
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95466:79"/>find any ſuch Article in any Creed, as this, I believe the High Church-Party of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And thus believing, they thus Reaſon, He that believes the Holy Catholick Church, takes himſelf to be a Member of that Church, and conſequently believes it his Duty to refuſe Communion with no Party of Chriſtians, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion does not neceſſitate him to Sin; and no Communion of Chriſtians, who are a Viſible Church of Chriſt, within the ſaid Deſcription, given by the ſaid 19th Article, do neceſſitate him to Sin.</p>
                  <p>They make a great difference between the Uſe of a Ceremony, or any indifferent thing about Religion, and the Impoſition thereof, as neceſſary to Communion in the Ordinances of Chriſt; and again, another difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Impoſition thereof by any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, or Diviſion of Chriſtians, on thoſe that Communicate with them, and the Separation of that Diviſion of Chriſtians, by ſuch Ceremony, or indifferent Thing, from the reſt of the Catholick Church. The Uſe therefore of a certain Ceremony, is what they do not ſcruple, as wearing a Gown or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, Standing at the Creed, Kneeling, or Standing, or Sitting at the Sacrament, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Uſage of that Party of Chriſtians, with whom they Communicate. Again, They don't ſcruple the like Ceremony, tho'
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95466:80"/>they be impoſed by the Government on any National Church, or Party of Chriſtians, ſo as they be not made Parties to the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or compelled to declare their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof by Word or Practiſe: It is their Judgment, That all Religion is Natural or Revealed; That there is no Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor any part of it, which is not found in the Word of God; That nothing ought to be impoſed amongſt Chriſtians, as a Term of Communion, which has not its Warrant from thence, according to the Senſe of the Primitive Church, and the whole Proteſtant Church at the firſt Reformation: And they think it abſurd to talk of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed Parts of Revealed Religion. It is therefore their Opinion, that if any Party of Chriſtians make a Law, That whoever communicates with them muſt uſe ſuch or ſuch an Unſcriptural Poſture or Ceremony, and muſt not have Communion with any other Chriſtians, who uſe not the ſame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' true Churches, according to the ſaid 19th Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and this under the Penalty of being ſtarved, or any other ſevere Penalty; they take that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians to be ſuch as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.21.</note> 
                     <hi>who frame Miſchief by a Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They think that ſuch Party of Chriſtians do thereby ſet up an unaccountable Schiſm in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95466:80"/>Catholick Church, and ſeparate themſelves from it, by ſetting up their Poſts by God's, and their own Threſholds by his, and their making a Wall between him and them; ſo that the Schiſm lies at their Door, and not at theirs, who, in Contradiction to ſuch a Law, continue Members of the Catholick Church. They are of Opinion, that the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are juſtly charged with the greateſt Schiſm that ever was in the Chriſtian World, becauſe they ſeparate themſelves from the Catholick Church by their new Articles of Faith, and Notorious Idolatries, which they impoſe as Terms of Communion; but they pretending, that the things which they impoſe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and to be comply'd with on Peril of Damnation, are not therefore ſo Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as that Party would be, who ſhould, by ſuch a Law, concerning things indifferent, ſeparate themſelves from all the reſt of the Catholick Church. The Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt therefore, by his Communicating with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> declares, That he takes it to be a ſound Part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; and his Communion with it, is Communion, with the Catholick Church, and not with a Party: He Communicates with it, becauſe he Agrees with it in all the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, tho' he Approves not of its Impoſitions: And his Communion with other Proteſtants, is Communion with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95466:81"/>the Catholick Church, of which he takes them alſo to be a ſound Part. By the firſt, he declares himſelf an Enemy to Separation; by the ſecond, to unneceſſary Impoſitions; by both, a Catholick Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>And he is the more confirmed in this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, becauſe of the plain Tendency of the Unſcriptural Terms of Communion, which the High Church-Party would eſtabliſh, to a Re-union with Popery, as is obvious to any Perſon who ſhall ſeriouſly conſider them. And for ſatisfaction therein, I would refer you (to avoid Repetition) to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of a little Diſcourſe, entituled, <hi>Catholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm without Popery;</hi> where this Matter is particularly Conſidered. And the Notions therein advanc'd have been effectually Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by the Oracle of your Party, the Author of the Caſe of the <hi>Regale &amp; Pontiſicat;</hi> a Book written directly againſt her Majeſty's Supremacy, and which has received a Second Edition; which aſſerts, That the Diſſenter will neither take nor give quarter, will neither propoſe nor accept any Terms of Reconciliation,<note place="margin">Page 255.</note> and cannot for that (unleſs only for that) Reaſon, be angry at the High-Party's ſeeking or offering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with others, who may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſed; and that the whole and only difference between that Party and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 244.</note> and which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95466:81"/>hinders Communion, is the Extents of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy, which the <hi>Galliean</hi> Church have thrown off as well as they. But that all the difference between the <hi>Popiſh French</hi> Church, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are ſo far Reconcilable, as not to hinder Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And propoſes (in the Firſt Edition) a Treaty between our Convocation, and the General Aſſembly of the <hi>Galliean</hi> Biſhops and Clergy; and complains in the Margin of the Second Edition, pag. 263. That the Engliſh Convocation not being ſuffered to ſit, while that of <hi>France</hi> laſted, rendered any Treaty betwixt them impracticable: And pag. 179. propoſes it (plainly as a means to this bleſſed End) that a Bill ſhould paſs, to render all thoſe that go to Meetings uncapable of any Place of Truſt or Profit in the Government: And that this muſt be the Reaſon of the Zeal of a certain Party therein, and nor a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious Regard to the Act of Uniformity, is further Evident, becauſe Bowing at the Name of Jeſus, and toward the Altar, tho' contrary to the Act of Uniformity, but ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying an inclination towards <hi>Popery,</hi> are as much practiſed and defended by that Party, as any Ceremonies eſtabliſh'd by that Law. The Occaſional Conformiſt therefore thinks himſelf bound in Conſcience to make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Difference in his Practiſe, between the regard he ſhews to the Commandments of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95466:82"/>God, and to the Inventions of Men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when thoſe Inventions are manifeſtly defended with the utmoſt Vigor, to keep a Correſpondence with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might here name many Things, which may be amended in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> But I had rather Convince you, that you are in a great Miſtake, when you affirm, That there is no way to heal Diviſions, but by ſuch a Bill as that againſt Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. And becauſe Her moſt Sacred and moſt Excellent Majeſty, is, I truſt, raiſed up by Almighty God to perfect that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both at Home and Abroad, which was ſo much advanc'd by Her Predeceſſor, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of Bleſſed Memory; and becauſe I take Her Reign to be a more proper Seaſon for ſuch a Work, than that of the late King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> tho' of Glorious Memory, for Reaſons eaſily Occurring to Men of Thought, and ſome of which ſhall be hereafter mentioned, I will venture to propoſe another Means to put an End to Faction, to ſecure the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace in Church and State, to remove the Cauſes of all our Fears, and of all our Diviſions, which is worth Ten Thouſand ſuch Bills, as that againſt Occaſional Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and which the Promoters of that Bill cannot refuſe to approve of, if they be hearty Lovers of her Majeſty, and the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95466:82"/>
                  <p>It were eaſie to prove what has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, that the Primitive Rule of Reformation, and the Rule univerſally uſed at the Reformation, was, That the Terms of Chriſtian Communion ought to be only ſuch as are found in the Scripture. And perhaps in another Diſcourſe, the World may ſee a full Evidence, That all the Miſchiefs that have happen'd to the Chriſtian Church have been occaſioned by departing from that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and an account may be given of the gradual Growth of Prieſtcraft, from the days of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> to the time of Cardinal <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>But before I mention the ſaid Means, of putting an End to Faction, I will only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that notwithſtanding by Stat. 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 14. Tranſubſtantiation, Communion in one Kind, Prohibition of Marriage to the Clergy, Monkiſh Vows, Private Maſſes, and Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confeſſion, are alſo Eſtabliſh'd by Act of Parliament; yet ſome time before, <hi>viz.</hi> 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. the King and Parliament did declare, That they did not intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline or vary from the Congregation of Chriſt's Church in any thing, concerning the very Articles of the Faith of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> or in any other things declared by Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Word of God, nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſary for their Salvation; and that this continued to be the Opinion even of the Popiſh Church
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95466:83"/>of <hi>England,</hi> appears from Stat. 1. <hi>Mar.</hi> Seſ. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Wherein the Marriage of Queen <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th is declared Lawful, and all Sentences of Divorce between them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed. And leſt the Queen and Parliament ſhould ſeem to enact any thing herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the aforeſaid Principle, It is thereby Enacted, <q>That the ſaid Marriage had and ſolemnized between the Queen's moſt Noble Father King <hi>Henry,</hi> and her moſt Noble Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> ſhould be definitively, clearly, and abſolutely declared, deemed, and adjudged to be, and ſtand with God's Law, and his moſt Holy Word:</q> So ſenſible were the Parliament in thoſe times, that <hi>God's Law, and his moſt Holy Word,</hi> ought to be the Rule of all things relating to Chriſtian Religion. And tho' an Act of Parliament will not make that ſtand with God's Law, and his moſt Holy Word, which does not ſtand therewith; yet the Wiſdom of the Nation at that time, and the Wiſdom of all Nations, and of all Pretenders to Eſtabliſh a Revealed Religion, ſuch as <hi>Numa, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> and others, have thought it neceſſary to pretend Divine Authority for all Matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Revealed Religion. And had that ſeemed Good to the Governors of Church and State in Chriſtian Countries, which ſeemed Good to the Holy Ghoſt, and the Apoſtles, Elders, or Presbyters and Brethren,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95466:83"/>met in the firſt Council of the Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem, viz.</hi> To impoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but neceſſary things. Had they taken the Prophet's Advice, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.14. <hi>Take up the ſtumbling Block out of the Way of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> inſtead of forcing them to uſe it, Popery had never riſen, but the Church had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Pure to the Worlds end.</p>
                  <p>But this being premiſed, I deſire you to remember, that when the Supremacy of the Pope was thrown off by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Crown reſtored to its Ancient Rights, it was by Stat. 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. Enacted, That the Convocation ſhould be Aſſembled by the King's Writs, and ſhould not Enact any Conſtitutions or Ordinances without the King's Aſſent. And it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enacted as follows, <q>And for as much as ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as heretofore have been made by the Clergy of this Realm, cannot now, at the Seſſion of this preſent Parliament, by reaſon of ſhortneſs of Time, be viewed, examined and determined, by the King's Highneſs, and Thirty Two Perſons, to be choſen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, according to the Petition of the ſaid Clergy, in form above rehearſed. Be it therefore Enacted, by the Authority above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, That the King's Highneſs ſhall have Power and Authority to nominate and aſſign at his pleaſure the ſaid Two and Thirty
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95466:84"/>Perſons of his Subject; whereof Sixteen to be of the Clergy, and Sixteen to be of the Temporalty of the Upper and Nether Houſe of the Parliament: And if any of the ſaid Two and Thirty Perſons ſo choſen ſhall happen to die before their full Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then His Highneſs to nominate other from time to time of the ſaid Two Houſes of the Parliament, to ſupply the Number of the ſaid Two and Thirty; and that the ſame Two and Thirty, by his Highneſs ſo to be named, ſhall have Power and Authority to view, ſearch and examine the ſaid Canons, Conſtitutions and Ordinances, Provincial and Synodal, heretofore made: And ſuch of them, as the King's Highneſs, and the ſaid Two and Thirty, or the more part of them, ſhall deem an adjudge worthy to be continued, kept, obeyed and executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realm; ſo that the King's moſt Royal Aſſent be firſt had to the ſame. And the reſidue of the ſaid Canons, Conſtitutions, and Ordinances Provincial, which the ſaid King's Highneſs, and the ſaid Two and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Perſons, or the more part of them, ſhall not approve, or deem and adjudge worthy, to be aboliſh'd, abrogate, and made fruſtrate, ſhall from thenceforth be void, and of none effect, and never be put in Execution within this Realm; provided alway, that no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Conſtitutions, or Ordinance, ſhall be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95466:84"/>made, or put in Execution, within this Realm, by Authority of the Convocation of the Clergy, which ſhall be contrariant or Repugnant to the King's Prerogative Royal, or the Cuſtoms, Laws, or Statutes of this Realm, any thing contained in this Act to the contrary hereof notwithſtanding. And in the cloſe of the ſaid Act it follows, Provided that ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions, and Synodals Provincial, being already made, which be not contrariant nor repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws, Statutes and Cuſtoms of this Realm, nor to the damage or hurt of the King's Prerogative Royal, ſhall now ſtill be uſed and executed, as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of this Act, till ſuch time as they be viewed, ſearched, or otherwiſe ordered and determined, by the ſaid Two and Thirty Perſons, or the more part of them, according to the Tenor, Form and effect of this preſent Act.</q> But nothing being done in purſuance of this Power, veſted in that King, thereby, the ſame was again Enacted, by Stat. 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 15. But the Power of <hi>Popery</hi> rendring that Law alſo Ineffectual, it was again, by Stat. 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 16. Enacted, That that King ſhould ſtill have the ſame Authority during his Life. But ſtill nothing was done, for the Prieſts choſe rather to continue the Canons, and Conſtitutions, and Laws Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95466:85"/>in the uncertainty in which they were left by the ſaid Stat. 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19. than that the King, and Sixteen of the Temporalty, ſhould intermeddle in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Eccleſiaſtical. But King <hi>H.</hi> 8. died, and left the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, as the were uneſtabliſh'd by the laſt mentioned Statute.</p>
                  <p>And the Reformation having made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Progreſs in the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. the like Power and Authority was again given to that King, by Stat. 3. and 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. c. 11. But ſtill the Old Leaven remained, and nothing was done in his ſhort Reign; and Popery returning to its Vigor under the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the aforeſaid Stat. of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 14. was Repealed, by Stat. 1. and 2, <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> c. 8. And although that Act was Revived again, by the Act of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. yet that Authority, which had been given to King <hi>H.</hi> 8. and King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. ſeems not to be given by that Act to Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> But by the ſame Act the High Commiſſion Court was created to Act under the Queen's Prerogative, which was quite another ſort of Authority, and left the Laws Eccleſiaſtical, as they were left by the Stat. 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19. And the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion being ſince found inconvenient, and condemned by Law, it ſeems to me, that ſomething remains to be done, for the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Church.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95466:85"/>
                  <p>And therefore, tho' I impute it to the Prevalency of Popery, that all thoſe Statutes were of no Effect; yet I would hope, that the Divine Providence did permit ſo many Laws of that Kind to be made with a deſign, that they might be Preſidents for the like Authority, to be veſted in our moſt Gracious Sovereign Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> whoſe Life hath ſet a rare Example of Chriſtian Piety, whoſe Reign the Almighty hath bleſt with the beſt Biſhops that ever fill'd the Engliſh Sees; and whoſe Care of all her Subjects hath been ſo often Expreſt, with ſuch moving Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents from the Throne; of whoſe Affection to the Church of <hi>England</hi> no Man can doubt, and who may eaſily render it a Means and Pattern of Union to all the Proteſtant Churches, and in a ſhort time to the whole Chriſtian World. I write not this without Ground, but with good Reaſon, and ſome Glimpſe of Hope.</p>
                  <p>Had any of the ſaid Statutes in the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 8. been purſued, Popery had been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtabliſh'd: And in the ſhort Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Things were yet in great Confuſion: Matters in Controverſie had not been fully diſcuſt; Laymen-had but juſt got the Bible, which is the Inſtructions left by our Bleſſed Saviour, into their Hands; and therefore could not ſo well judge, whether his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors followed his Inſtructions or no.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95466:86"/>Humane Inventions had ſo long been made Equal to Divine Inſtitutions, that it was not eaſie at that time to diſtinguiſh them: And conſidering the groſs Ignorance that abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Clergy, when the Tranſition was made from Popery to the Proteſtant Religion by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that the Reformation ſhould have made ſo great a Progreſs, as it did in her Reign. During the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Matches, the Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and yet the Ambition of that King, diverted his Thoughts to other Matters, than the Eſtabliſhment of the Church; but yet a ſtep was made towards it by the new Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Bible, which was made in his Reign. During the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, the <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> Deſign of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union to <hi>Rome,</hi> was purſued with great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; and therefore no wonder, that a better Eſtabliſhment of the Church was not attempted in his Reign: And perhaps, till the Miſchief of Enthuſiaſm had ſhewed us the neceſſity of a National Church, it would have been difficult to have brought the Diſſenters to any Reaſonable Terms of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore the firſt Opportunity, which ſeems to me to have preſented it ſelf for ſuch an Attempt, was at the Reſtoration of the Royal Family, when it was in the Power of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95466:86"/>Eſtabliſh'd the Church on ſuch Foundations, as would eaſily have taken into her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion almoſt all Denominations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who had not caſt oft the Ordinances of Chriſt, and their Allegiance to the Civil Government: But the foreign Education of the Royal Brothers had ſixt their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a Union with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Fear, under which King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second laboured, was not, leſt the Diſſenters ſhould not comply with the Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but leſt they ſhould. One Party was to be turn'd out, that another might be brought in: So that this time was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved towards our Union. But after that, Popery appear'd barefac'd, under the late King <hi>James</hi> the Second, and Advances were made, both by the Church-Party and the Diſſenters, towards Union at the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that Seaſon was look'd upon as a happy Juncture for ſuch an Attempt. But to ſpeak my Mind freely, although I think no Man can give an Inſtance wherein his late Majeſty King <hi>William</hi> ſhewed any want of Affection to this National Church; yet his Education under another ſort of Church-Government, did, as I apprehend, cauſe the Church Party to take Umbrage, as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to bend the Conſtitution in the Church too much toward the Diſſenter: And might alſo occaſion in the Diſſenter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95466:87"/>Expectations of greater Conceſſions, than are neceſſary to Peace and Unity.</p>
                  <p>But the Miſchiefs of Enthuſiaſm in the late Times, the Perſecution of the Epiſcopal Party then, and of the Diſſenters in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the terrible Viſage of returning Popery under the late King <hi>James,</hi> have occaſioned great Thoughts of Heart. All things are now ſet in the cleareſt Light; a better Friend to the Church can never fill the Engliſh Throne; the terms of Catholick Unity are well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, both by the Clergy, and many of the Laity; while the Church has ſtood upon Stilts,<note n="*" place="margin">Ceremonies.</note> it has been ſometimes bending towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and at other times towards Enthuſiaſm; but by this means it may be unmoveably fixt upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf being the chief Corner Stone. And this in ſhort is what I would offer on this Subject, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty may receive the like Authority by Act of Parliament, as that ſo often given to King <hi>H.</hi> 8. and after to <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. By this means, inſtead of our being curſed once a Year, on <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> the Church may obtain the Benefit of that Godly Diſcipline, which the Rubrick wiſhes to be Reſtored. The Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be made a Form to ſome, and at leaſt a Directory,

                  <p>And therefore to uſe the Word of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Reaſons for paſſing the late Bill,</hi> with a very little Variation, they being as I conceive, much more for my purpoſe than his. <q>Since the Security of Particulars, that is the Innocent, the Honeſt and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for no body, I ſuppoſe, means to incourage the wicked Seditions, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them in their Crimes,</q> (<hi>Such as that High Church-man, who has lately Publiſh'd a Latin Treatiſe, to prove the preſent Church of</hi> England <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> At leaſt this is not a Deſign that will bear the Light,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>ſince the Peace and Proſperity of the Nation in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, by the Encouragement of Induſtry, and Increaſe of Trade, by the Benefit and Comforts of Society, by Dutiful and Chearful Submiſſion to thoſe whom God God has ſet over us in Church and State, by a moſt Cordial and Loyal Obedience to Her Majeſty, and Grateful Sence of the Bleſſings we enjoy under Her Juſt and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Government; ſince the Wiſdom and Piety of our Legiſlators, the Sagacity of their Judgments, the Weight and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95466:88"/>of their Deliberations, their Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and Firmneſs in the Purſuit of fit and neceſſary Meaſures, and the Nobleneſs of their Reſolution in overcoming all Difficulties; ſince the Honour and Felicity of Her Majeſties moſt Auſpicious Reign, Her Reputation abroad, and Intereſt at home, the Praiſe and Veneration that will be paid Her now, and that Renown that will attend Her to all Succeeding Ages, for ſecuring to all Poſterity, that unvaluable Bleſſing which was Eſtabliſhed by Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Predeceſſor, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of truly Glorious Memory: And as Her Majeſty was pleaſed to tell us very lately, even Her preſent Satisfaction, and what ſhe has moſt at Heart. And above all, ſince the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Religion, and the Glory of God, are ſo nearly concerned in this Buſineſs, and that Temporal and narrow Aims may be caſhiered, Brotherly Love revived, and the little things that divide us, giving place to the more Weighty that ought to unite us. We may henceforth only contend for the Faith, which was once delivered, and that Purity of Manners which is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Effect of it. Let us unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>in enabling Her Majeſty to give</hi> all that Security <hi>and Perfection</hi> to our moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conſtitution, which it may juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at our Hands.</p>

                     <p>Nor is it the Church only that requires this, 'tis the State likewiſe which muſt ſtand or fall with Her. For the ſake then of our moſt Wiſe and Conſtituted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which all Strangers envy, and which we ſeem to pride our ſelves ſo much upon, for the ſake of our Moſt Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, than whom never any merited more at our Hands, and who ſo pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſes us to perfect Peace and Union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves; and who declares She hath nothing ſo much at Heart as the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Happineſs of Her Subjects, who manages that Treaſure ſo carefully, which we have ſeen formerly ſquandered away ſo profuſely <hi>on</hi> French <hi>Intrigues and Whores,</hi> loads her People with no Deficiencies, but even Taxes her ſelf to eaſe her Subjects; and if the moſt ſhining Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs placed upon a Throne can affect us, <hi>if ſhe be as worthy to be truſted as Hen.</hi> 8. for the ſake of our Countrey, for whoſe Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare we profeſs ſuch a mighty Concern, and of which we would be thought ſuch Zealous Patriots; for our own dear ſakes, that moſt powerful Motive with all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and laſtly, even for God's ſake, for the Honour and Glory of his Holy Name, which ought to weigh with us above all other Conſiderations.</p>

                     <hi>Let us not after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting a Bill againſt Immorality be ſo fond of a

                     <q>Let us at laſt diſcern the things that belong to our Peace, and God forbid that they ſhould at any time, this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially be hid from our Eyes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, Sir, having offered to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſuch Principles as I my ſelf act by, and which I conceive are agreeable to the Opinion of moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Occaſional Conformiſts, and Occaſional Diſſenters, and propoſed an Expedient for the Eſtabliſhment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I conceive far more likely to unite us, than the late Bill if it had paſt, and applied the Pathetick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of one of your Party to this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. I ſhall next conſider what ever ſeems to me remain unanſwered in your Diſcourſe. And, firſt, I cannot but admire that you who have pronounc'd that Her Majeſty is none of the three Eſtates of the Realm, but the Sovereign Head of that Great Body, ſhould in the very ſame Page allow Her no more than a Councurrence with what Her Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould <hi>conceive to</hi> be reaſonable; for methinks, <hi>conceiving</hi> what is reaſonable, ſhould be at leaſt as proper for the Head as the Members.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95466:89"/>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs that I concur with you in believing that Her Majeſties Allies would not have been offended at the Wiſdom of that Bill, had it paſt into a Law, becauſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they could not have diſcerned it, and it would probably have been the more inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, becauſe it was ſo conſpicuous to all the Papiſts and Jacobites in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as to the Prophetick Part of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, how much the Diſſenter would have been pleaſed to know the extent of his Priviledges, or how contented he would be, or what Advantage would accreue from ſuch Gentle Methods, or in the words of <hi>Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Moyens deux &amp; voyes de Grace,</hi>

                  <p>I muſt alſo take time for further Thought, or deſire, further Information, what thoſe Truths are, which in your Preface you ſay you do with Deference and Reſpect to the Houſe of Lords, and in a decent and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner endeavour to Eſtabliſh; for as to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95466:90"/>your two main Pillars, other Hands have ſufficiently ſhewed that they are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pillars of Truth.</p>
                  <p>I am alſo, with great Submiſſion, much ſurprized, to be told, <hi>Page</hi> 6. that the ſame Arguments were made uſe of againſt this Bill, which were formerly inſiſted on for Repealing all the Teſt-Laws whatſoever, for many of the Great and Wiſe Men in the Kingdom, and more eſpecially in <hi>Shropſhire, Herefordſhire,</hi> and thereabouts, do well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the way to <hi>Peace at Home,</hi> was with much Eloquence declared to be by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing thoſe Laws, when to Repeal them, was manifeſtly to ſerve a Popiſh Intereſt, and with no leſs Aſſurance, when the late Bill was promoted, when the ſame End would have been ſerved, tho' by quite contrary Means; ſo that one at leaſt of thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would have been very acceptable to me, who have always thought that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for Repealing thoſe Laws in a Popiſh Reign, were of the ſame Size with thoſe that are urged for rendring thoſe Laws more ſtrict and ſevere in the Reign of a Proteſtant Queen. <q>Concerning this Matter, therefore,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Preface to</hi> Peace at Home.</note> there are ſome Miſtakes and Miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I doubt that do ſtill prevail with ſome Perſons, and ſeem to call for a further Explanation of it.</q> And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95466:90"/>perhaps that the ſame Arguments were uſed for both theſe Purpoſes, would be as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Truth, if it were made out, as any other of the Truths endeavoured to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by your Diſcourſe. But tho' I was againſt Repealing the Teſt in a Popiſh Reign, I Publiſh'd ſome Reaſons for Repealing ſome part of it in a Proteſtant Reign, which I have added to this Letter, No. 1. for your Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>That the Bill affected only thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſſenters, who thought fit to Conform for an Office, but would not Conform for the Unity of the Church, is another of your Truths which needs to be eſtabliſh'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on the contrary, it ſeems to affect my Occaſional Conformiſt, or rather Occaſional Diſſenter, nay to be principally levell'd at him, who conforms meerly for the Unity of the Church, and not for an Office, who endeavours to preſerve the Unity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, from being rent as often as a Whimſey ſhall take any Sett of Men, to be adding their own Inventions to Chriſtianity; and then to call themſelves the Church; to make a parcel of Ceremonies, Articles of Communion; whereas the 39 Articles of the Church are not ſo, if you believe your Oracle.</p>
                  <p>One Truth indeed you have taught, us out of the Preamble of the intended Bill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Occaſional Conformity, viz.</hi> That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95466:91"/>is more contrary to the Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, and particularly to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than Perſecution for Conſcience ſake only.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore, it ſeems to be Enacted, to this effect, That whoſoever being in a Publick Office would not join himſelf to the High Church Party, ſo as never more to Communicate with any other part of the Chriſtian World, altho' he believed the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholick Churah, and endeavoured to ſhew his Faith by his Works, ſhould forfeit his Office and a Fine of 100 <hi>l.</hi> to the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the Man did Communicate with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Chriſtians out of Conſcience, as is aboveſaid, would not this be Perſecution for Conſcience only? And, pray, Sir, was not the danger of Eſtabliſhing the aforeſaid <hi>Truth</hi> the true Reaſon why that <hi>Truth</hi> was left out of the Preamble in the Second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Bill? And this Queſtion I ask you with the greater Freedom, tho' with great Submiſſion, becauſe this Truth being once in the Preamble of that Bill, is uſed by you as an Anſwer to the Objection, That they who think the being preſent at a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſo high a Crime, can hardly think that Toleration of ſuch Meetings ought to continue, which by Reaſon of the ſaid Truth, being in the ſaid Preamble, you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95466:91"/>to be an hard, not to ſay unwarrantable and uncharitable Cenſure on the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the People.</p>
                  <p>I don't ſay, Sir, That going to a Meeting is now by the Toleration Act Eſtabliſh'd, or made part of our Conſtitution thereby. But I ſay, that if the Creed be part of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, if the Articles of the Church be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part, and the Meeting be within the Deſcription of the ſaid 19th Article, going to it is Eſtabliſhed both by Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p>But I apply to your Queſtions, which I am willing to take as the chief Points, and to expect a good Iſſue, not from the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but Strength of the Reader's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>Now, that I may keep to the Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Debate, I muſt take leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide theſe Queſtions into ſeveral Heads, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeem to me too perplex'd as they are ſtated; and therefore ſeeing the Subject Matter is <hi>Occaſional Conformity,</hi> or <hi>Occaſional Nonconformity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us conſider whether the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Conformiſt, or rather the Occaſional Diſſenter be not a ſincere Member of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, who heartily approves of the Laws of the Land, and chearfully pays Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them, and whether he and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95466:93"/>Churchman be of oppoſite Principles, or of one and the ſame Perſwaſion in Matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether if the Occaſional Bill had paſſed, it had ſecured the Government from ſuch, who are not ſincere Members of the National Church, nor heartily approve of the Laws of the Land, nor chearfully pay Obedience to them, but are of oppoſite Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and not of one and the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in Matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the Adminiſtration of Publick Aſtairs may not be in the Hands of Perſons who are not of one and the ſame Perſwaſion in Matters of Religion, nay, of Men of oppoſite Principles, without Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or tearing the Government in pieces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and whether they may not, notwithſtanding draw together the ſame way for the Publick Good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether it is ſit that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration and Teſt Acts ſhould be enfore'd or Repealed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether upon the whole Matter the Occaſional Conformiſt may not be admitted into Publick Offices and Employments relating to the Government, conſiſtently with the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Eſtabliſhed Government, both in Church and State, with the Wiſdom of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95466:94"/>
                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and with the Practice of ſome wiſe Governments in the World.</p>
                  <p>And as to the firſt, I anſwer that the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Conformiſt is a ſincere Member of the National Church, who heartily approves of the Laws of the Land, and chearfully pays Obedience to them, and he and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not of oppoſite Principles, but of one and the ſame Perſwaſion in Matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>If the Church-man, whom you ſuppoſe the only Perſon fit for an Office, be one that troubles not himſelf about Religion, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves as the Church believes, and does as he ſees others do. I neither can judge of his Principles nor his Perſwaſion in Matters of Religion; but if he have eſpouſed the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and can give a Reaſon of the Faith or Hope that is in him; he knows that the Religion of this National Church is all to be found in the Bible. He is taught by the ſixth Article of that Church, that Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture containeth all things neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that whatſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of any Man that it ſhould be believ'd as an Article of Faith, or be thought requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite or neceſſary to Salvation. The Reaſon given by the 8th Article, why the three Creeds ought throughly to be received and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95466:94"/>believed, is, for that they may be proved by moſt certain Warrants of Holy Scripture. And as to Creeds, ſo as to Councils, we are taught by the 21ſt Article, that things Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by them as neceſſary to Salvation, have neither Strength nor Authority, only as it may be declared, that they be taken out of Holy Scripture. Now the Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts are herein intirely of the ſame mind, they agree intirely in the Creeds, the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Decalogue, and as explained by our Saviour. In the two Sacraments, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Part and Article that any Proteſtant can have any Colour to call a part of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>But I have not Inclination, nor can it be expected that I ſhould particularize every Head and Point of Religion, wherein they agree; but ſhould be glad to be informed by you of any Article of Religion, or Point of Doctrine wherein they differ; for no Man ever called Rites and Ceremonies of humane Inſtitution, Principles or Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I muſt own that they are not fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the large Senſe of that Paſſage in the 20th Article, That the Church hath Power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, nor that, as the 34th Article expreſſes it, it is ſufficient as to the Ceremonies, that nothing be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained againſt God's Word, if the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95466:95"/>of God's Word be intended a particular expreſs Oppoſition; but they are of opinion, that to make any Rites or Ceremonies of Humane Inſtitution, neceſſary to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially as is aforeſaid, to make them Terms of Separation from the reſt of the Catholick Church is againſt God's Word, but they are extricated out of this Difficulty by the laſt Clauſe of the 34th Article, it being plain by long and pungent Experience, that the Ordaining of ſuch Rites and Ceremonies, is not among the Things that have been done ſo edifying, or if this ſhould fail, yet your ſaid Oracle is expreſs that the 39 Articles are required from no Layman, a Licence for which no Occaſional Conformiſt will thank him.</p>
                  <p>The Romaniſts by ſuch Ordinance have indeed edified their Babel, and from things not contrary have proceeded to ordain things deſtructive to Chriſtianity, and ſo in ſome Meaſure are all ſuch Ordinances, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as much from Religion as Chriſtianity does from Prieſtcraft.</p>
                  <p>But to bring this Matter a little cloſer, I hope to make it plain, that not only the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Conformiſt, but the Presbyterian, and the Independent are of the ſame Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Matters of Religion with the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and not of oppoſite Principles, and that nothing but groſs Ignorance, or a wilful
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95466:95"/>blind Prejudice has kept Men of either Party from being convinc'd of this Truth. And to make this evident, I take leave to acquaint you with plain Matter of Fact. You well know, that in the late times the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as alſo the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> agreed in a Catechiſm, called the Aſſemblies ſhorter Catechiſm. And this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm was alſo agreed to by the Synod of the Independent Divines, met at the <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after the Reſtauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. and particularly ſome time before the Popiſh Plot, a mighty Zeal appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Catechiſm in the Men of your Party, and if I miſtake not, this Catechiſm was publickly burnt at <hi>Oxford.</hi> But it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that one Mr. <hi>Thomas Adams,</hi> formerly fellow of <hi>Brazen-Noſe-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> being convinc'd of the Truth of what I am endeavouring to prove; he in the Year, 1675, wrote a Diſcourſe, Entituled, <hi>The Main Principles of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> in 107 ſhort Articles, or Aphoriſms, generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as being proved from Scripture, now further cleared and confirmed by the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Doctrine, Recorded in the Articles and Homilies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> under 4 Heads.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:95466:96"/>

                  <p>Which Diſcourſe was Licenſed, Sold well, and received a Second Edition in 1677, (which I have) but alaſs it was at laſt diſcovered that the 107 Articles were the Anſwers to the 107 Queſtions of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies Shorter Catechiſm, and that hated Book was thus diſper'd under the Patronage of the Articles and Homilies of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And if you will pleaſe to peruſe this Book, I ſuppoſe you will need no other Proof, that the Occaſional Conformiſt, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, Independent, and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, are not of oppoſite Principles, but of one and the ſame Perſwaſion in Matters of Religion; and the Acceptation which that Diſcourſe met with, puts me in mind of a like Paſſage relating to the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> to whom your Oracle, above-mention'd, deſires that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95466:96"/>the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be united; for when <hi>Abbas le Roy</hi> Publiſh'd a Diſcourſe in <hi>France,</hi> without naming the Author, being a moſt Elegant and Pious Oration, or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for obtaining the Grace of a perfect Converſion, the <hi>Sorbon</hi> condemned it, becauſe they believed it to be written by a <hi>Janſeniſt;</hi> but ſome Years after a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhop having Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue, and Publiſh'd it with the Approbation of the Doctor's of the Holy Inquiſition, <hi>Peſonius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And thus have I known a fierce <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterian ſit with Reverence and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a long time, while one of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance rend diverſe parts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, but as ſoon as it was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how the Perſon was entertained, my Friend, who was a tall Man, was glad to make the beſt uſe of his long Legs. And here I will mention an Obſervation which I have frequently made; That if you hear a Man declaring that no Man can be ſerious in the uſe of the Common Prayer, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God thereby with Fervency and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction 'tis forty to one, that the Man never tried? On the other hand, if you hear a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95466:97"/>exclaiming againſt Extempore Prayer, calling it Cant and Nonſenſe, 'tis as many to one that he never heard an Extempore Prayer in his Life; but now there is one Occaſional Conformiſt to my knowledge, and I believe ſome thouſands that have joined in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God by the Common-Prayer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, and have alſo joined in Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Him as often with thoſe that uſe no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable Form, who can teſtifie with great Aſſurance that both thoſe ſorts of People are wretchedly miſtaken, who can tell you that they know no reaſon why Chriſtians ſhould not agree in a Form as to the Matter of Prayer, as well as of Belief, or why thoſe who make no ſcruple to ſing the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Metre, by <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins,</hi> which is for the moſt part but a wretched Form of the Matter of Praiſe, ſhould ſcruple the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, which is much nearer Scripture Language, than the aforeſaid Verſion of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> That it is a very agreeable Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that many Thouſands of Pious Souls are at the ſame time joining in Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God in the ſame words, as well as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires without Idolatry, and without any of the Additions made by the Papacy to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and in the beſt Liturgy in the World. Eſpecially when they conſider that the 4 living Creatures, improperly call'd Beaſts in our Tranſlation, and the 24 Presbyters or Elders, which repreſent the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95466:97"/>Chriſtian Church, are repreſented as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſing the ſame Form of Thankſgiving, and the like Forms are found, 5 <hi>Rev.</hi> 9, 12, 13. 7 <hi>Rev.</hi> 10, 12. 11 <hi>Rev.</hi> 17, 18. 15 <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 19 <hi>Rev.</hi> 1, 2, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame Perſons can at the ſame time aſſure you that they never heard Cant or Nonſence among thoſe who pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Form, but for the moſt part the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions taken out of the Scripture, the Prayers generally Premeditated, Methodical, Reverend and fervent, accommodated to the various Circumſtances of the Intereſts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World, both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and the various Dangers or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under which the Nation may be, and to the Bleſſings of Heaven received: They that ſo pray are never hindred from giving Thanks for Victories, becauſe 'tis <hi>Lent,</hi> nor from Humiliation under Judgments; becauſe 'tis <hi>Chriſtmaſs.</hi> They uſually have reſpect to the Subject Matter of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which is a very good Preparation for Attention, and a Means of ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They can ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſuitably accomodate their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Circumſtances of Families, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Matter of Prayer or Thankſgiving, for which it is impoſſible that any, or all the Liturgies in the World can ſuffice. Again, theſe Occaſional Conformiſts ſinding that the bleſſed Spirit, as a Spirit of Grace and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95466:98"/>Supplication, is to convert the <hi>Jews, Zach.</hi> 12.10. that in the 8 <hi>Rom.</hi> 26. The Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit in Prayer is expreſt by a word alluding to a Perſon, who being to lift at a Beam, has one that helps him to lift both at the end of which he has hold, and at the other end too, or ſignifying ſuch a help, as when one that is ſtrong taketh up a Burden over-againſt another who is too weak, and alſo ſets his Shoulders againſt the other to lift up the Burden <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from theſe and other places of Sacred Scripture, they are apt to gather that the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit in Prayer ought not to be confined (I ſay, confined) to an invariable ſet Form of Humane Compoſure, or only to enable the Miniſter to read a Prayer Audibly and Reverently, nor are they willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Act of Uniformity in ſuch a Senſe as this. That from, and after the 24th Day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1662, neither the Parts nor Learning of any Miniſter of the Goſpel, nor the Gift of Prayer, nor the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit in the Matter of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhould be of any further uſe in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God. They think it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Men may make an Idol of Words as well as of Wood or Stone, and they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that where the Spirit is rejected as a Spirit of Supplication, he oft refuſes to act as a Spirit of Grace. And herein on Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95466:98"/>I do verily believe that the good Church-man, and the Occaſional Conformiſt are of the ſame Mind.</p>
                  <p>But further, as to all the Matters in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between the Church-man, and the Presbyterian, and Independent, as well as between Him and the Occaſional Conformiſt, which concern Matters of Ceremonies, and Humane Additions, ſuch as the Sign of the Croſs at Baptiſm, the Poſture of Kneeling at the Sacrament, and the Surplice; your Oracle above-mention'd, has agreed, That it is lawful for the Church to diſpenſe with their Rites and Ceremonies and if lawful, then neceſſary to heal the Schiſm of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, <hi>Page</hi> 247, That if they would all agree, which of the indifferent things would purchaſe their Reconciliation, the Church would readily grant it for ſo good an End. <hi>Page</hi> 254.</p>
                  <p>Indeed in another Form, <hi>viz.</hi> As a Wolf ſtrip'd of his Shepherds Cloathing, he has been howling about the Streets for ſome time <q>againſt the Diſſenters, and Occaſional Conformiſts, Proteſtants, Jeſuits, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Doctrines, Diabolical Seed, Fruit of Blood, Maſſacre, and all Wickedneſs, Wild Enthuſiaſm, Laodicean Latitude which God abhors. Evil Beaſts, always Lyars, Hideous Blaſphemy, Furious Phanaticks, Impudence and Blaſphemy, Grin of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

That the High Church ſhould have little Quarrel with the Diſſenters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all the Objections they make as to Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgy, and even the Grand Point of Ordination by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in caſe of Neceſſity, and where a Biſhop could not be had, if it were not for that fulſom word Schiſm. If they did not gather ſeparate Congregations, and ſet them up in Oppoſition to the Church, they would be no Diſſenters, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their different Sentiments, as to the Points before mention'd; for there are thoſe in the Communion of the Church, who may differ in Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe things, and may Reaſon and Argue them over with one another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Breach of Charity, or of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, which requires not that all Men ſhould be exactly of the ſame Opinion in Matters of Diſcipline, nor nof Faith, but of one Communion, this preſerves the Unity of the Church.</q>

                  <p>Well ſaid, <hi>Wolf,</hi> when you ſpeak of the Church, do but mean the Church in your Creed, and fare-wel the Occaſional Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt; for he does none of thoſe ill things you complain of, but is Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> your very humble Servant, and very fit for an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. <hi>Page</hi> 80. Occaſional Conformity has no ill Conſequence, and is far from inferring <q>of no Church, and no Religion at all. I acknowledge with that Author, that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the true Notion of the Church, and the Prieſthood as Inſtituted by Chriſt,</q> is really of Conſequence, and therefore in that little Diſcourſe, Entituled, <hi>Catholociſm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Popery,</hi> I did earneſtly requeſt that it might be done for the Reaſons therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Page</hi> 4.5, 6. And there is the more Reaſon to deſire it, becauſe elſe 'tis hard to judge who are of oppoſite Principles, and not of one and the ſame Perſwaſion in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; eſpecially ſince the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Oracle, alias High <q>Church <hi>Wolf,</hi> tells us that the 39 Articles are not ſo much as Articles of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Page</hi> 16.</note> far leſs of Faith. He tells us that they are required from no Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or any other but the Clergy who are in Office. That there may be an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity in the Doctrine publickly Preach'd.</q> So then Uniformity in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that are neither Matters of Faith nor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95466:100"/>Communion, Conſtitutes the Church, or is the Church-man then the Hypocrite, inſtead of the Occaſional Conformiſt, being obliged to Subſcribe and Preach a Doctrine in the Name of God, which he does not believe, and are the Ceremonies and Humane Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, more conſiderable in the Conſtitution of the Church than the 39 Articles?</p>
                  <p>But in truth this Matter ought to be ſearch'd to the bottom, and I am led to it by the ſame Author, who in the beginning of that Diſcourſe, obſerves that there is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake about the word Moderation; for that it appears by the Context,<note place="margin">Page <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> the Original Word means a <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and chearful Suffering of Afflictions.</hi> So that inſtead of 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 5. <hi>Let your Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be known unto all Men,</hi> being a Text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Perſecution, it ſeems 'tis a Text that ſuppoſes Perſecution. I muſt ſay that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with any Body that argued Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency as to Religion from that Text, but ſurely 'tis violently ſcrew'd to make it favour Perſecution.<note place="margin">Page. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> But 'tis obſerved, that this word is found but once in all our Bible; and the word Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is found no oftner;<note place="margin">Page <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> and yet what work have we about that Word. Laymen are not obliged to the Articles of the Church, but only the Clergy who are in Office; but how if the Laymen be the Clergy,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95466:100"/>that is, I mean God's Clergy or Inheritance for the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, at leaſt in that Senſe is found no where in the Bible, but 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. where St. <hi>Peter</hi> having ſtyl'd himſelf a fellow Presbyter, exhorts the Presbyters to their Duty to feed the Flock of God, which was among them, as Biſhops thereof, not by conſtraint, but willingly, not for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lucre, but of a ready Mind, neither as being Lords over God's Clergy (which we read Heritage) but being Enſamples to the Flock. Now this Epiſtle being Written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year of our Lord 64, 'tis remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he who was an Apoſtle, and a Partaker of the Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt above 30 Years before, calls himſelf a fellow Presbyter, which for ſome Reaſon, or other, our Tranſlation reads an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Exhorts the Presbyters, which we read Elders, to Epiſcopize which we read, taking the over-ſight: But the thing which I would here obſerve, is that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as the late Learned Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſt <hi>Gregory</hi> reads it out of <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> is not the Prieſts but the People, however the Prieſts afterwards came to engroſs the Name. One thing I would therefore deſire of the Prieſts that they would let us in again for a Share at leaſt, and not believe that they only are God's Clergy or Inheritance. I wou'd alſo intreat them, that they would not be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95466:101"/>the Church, becauſe tho' that word is uſed in the New Teſtament about one hundred times, yet it is not once uſed for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters without the People. I know 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where the word is twice found, but no where elſe in any of the four Evangeliſts, it muſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Miniſters; but not to enter now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Controverſie, 'tis ſtrange that in the other 99 Places it ſhould ſignifie no ſuch thing, and therefore ſince the People are 99 parts at leaſt of the Church. I would not have the Prieſts paſs for the Church, and if theſe two things be granted me, I fancy we ſhall by and by come into a fair way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the World from that Controverſie about Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But I can't here omit to give you a ſhort hint of what may perhahs be more fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd elſewhere. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. Tells us that the Day of Judgment ſhould not come till there had been an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, or falling away, and that Man of Sin be revealed, and ſo goes on, deſcribing the Papacy moſt accurately. But I muſt own that till I read <hi>Irenaeus</hi> that beſt piece of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtianity, I never underſtood the meaning of that Name <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But that Primitive Father acquaints us that

                     </note> invented a new ſort of God's, called <hi>Aeons,</hi> of whom they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd originally but four,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Cap. <hi>1.</hi>

And hence alſo we may gather who that Whore is that we read of in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> even this ſame Wife of <hi>Anthropos,</hi> which ſeems to me to be the Reaſon why in that whole Book after the third Chapter you never meet with the word Church, till after the end of the Prophecy, and this perhaps is alſo the Reaſon why the Reformed Chriſtian Church of the latter Days is called the Bride, the Lamb's Wife: A Bride in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Whore, and the Bride the Lamb's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95466:102"/>Wife in oppoſition to the Wife of <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos.</hi> But this, by the way, only obſerve that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the Father of theſe <hi>Aeons</hi> was, if you believe <hi>Baronius,</hi> fetch'd down out of the Air by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Prayers at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 45, about 4 Years before St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> And take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice alſo that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his 33 <hi>d.</hi> Chapter of his firſt Book, obſerves, that Ignorance and Impudence, Falſe Zeal, Fury, Envy, and Luſt, were ſaid to be born about the ſame time with this ſame bleſſed couple.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, you muſt excuſe me if I have no kindneſs for any of the Off-ſpring of theſe Folk, and if I find any thing put upon me as part of Revealed Religion, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be begot by <hi>Anthropos on Eccleſia,</hi> and if you or the Men of your Party Write as many Books as would fill the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> in behalf of ſuch things, I ſhall ſtill remember ſuch Texts as theſe, to the Law, and to the Teſtimony.

Do not all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men know that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Great, who began his Popedom about the Year 440, in his 87th and 90th Epiſtles, is expreſs for a pular Election of Biſhops. And altho' Pope <hi>Symmachus</hi> in the latter end of the Fifth Century, about the Year 498, endeavoured to exclude the People from the Election, yet Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> the Second, in the Year 1143, was the firſt Pope made without the Peoples Election, even in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> where Prieſteraft did moſt prevail.

I don't pretend to determine how far the Civil Power may enforce Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd. Religion, but I hope all Chriſtian
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95466:105"/>Princes and States will take care that the Prieſts add not to, or diminiſh from our Chriſtianity in any Form, and let them be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, as they may, but for God's ſake let Diſcipline be reſtored, and then 'tis no great matter in what Form the Prieſts are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>
                  <p>Let every Miniſter who has the Cure of Souls, be enabled to exerciſe <hi>Diſciplinam Chriſti,</hi> which I am ſure is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and perhaps the Reduction of Epiſcopacy to the Form of Synodical Government, by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> tho' not <hi>Jure Divine,</hi> would be found ſo agreeable to Reaſon, ſuitable to Primitive Practice, and accomodate to the Ends of Diſcipline, that a due Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof might in a while bring all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches into the ſame Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without the Pretence of a <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> for it. Let us have no Laws about the Matter of Reveal'd Religion, but what are at leaſt plainly juſtified by the Scripture, and not be hampered by the Prieſts Additions in any Form; and Diſcipline will be eaſie and without Difficulty. But if the Pariſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may not Excommunicate a Notorious Convicted Atheiſt, Deiſt, Blaſphemer, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, Prophane Swearer, Sabbath-breaker, Abuſer of Parents, Murderer, Adulterer, Thief, Perjured Perſon, Extortioner, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retor, and ſuch like; but muſt complain to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95466:106"/>the Dioceſan, and an Appeal muſt lie to the Archbiſhop, the ſame Reaſon may carry it to the Pope, tho' our Laws juſtly prohibit it. So in the other Form of Government, if ſuch a Criminal, after Conviction by Law, may appeal from his Paſtor to the Seſſions, thence to the Presbytery, thence to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and thence to the General Aſſembly, the ſame Reaſon will carry it to a General Council, and I think there ought to be one Appeal more in ſuch Caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Day of Judgment. Indeed, if Prieſts may make us a Horſe-load of Canons and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Eccleſiaſtical, and load us with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, of which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Januarius,</hi> complains, that the Condition of the <hi>Jews</hi> was more tolerable than of the Church in his Time, (which was the 5th.

                  <p>But the Laws of God are plain, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required by Chriſtianity are well known, and I am ſo far from Abridging the Miniſters of the Goſpel of their juſt Power, that I think 'tis a horrid ſhame that they have not more. 'Tis an excellent Paſſage, cited out of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> by the late Author of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95466:106"/>
                     <hi>a Diſcourſe called the Principle of the Proteſtant Reformation.</hi>
                     <q>I am fully aſſured that God doth not, and therefore that Man ought not to require any more of any Man than this; to Believe the Scripture to be God's word, to endeavour to find the true Senſe of it, and to Live according to it; The Bible, the Bible, I ſay the Bible only is the Religion of Proteſtants.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though I agree with the Author, page 5. That a Perſon by Baptiſm is not made a Member of any particular Church, but only of the Chriſtian Church Univerſal; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he is wretchedly out, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates, That there is no Part of Primitive Church Communion, which might not have been performed by a Woman, as well as a Man; and that a Woman's Narrative would have been part of the Goſpel: Becauſe that Bible tells me not, that our Saviour had any She-Apoſtles or Evangeliſts. Indeed <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> as well as <hi>Aquila,</hi> did inſtruct <hi>Apollos;</hi> but ſo may any good Woman inſtruct her Friend, without being a Church-Officer. And the Context of that Paſſage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21. which he quotes, ſeems to inſinuate, as if this Fancy of a Female Officer had got footing in the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> but the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That the Head of the Woman is the Man,</hi> ver. 3. and that <hi>ſhe ought to have Power, or a Covering on her Head:</hi> So far from being <hi>heard,</hi> that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95466:107"/>ſhe was not to be <hi>ſeen.</hi> And in the next Chapter, v. 28, &amp; 29. he ſpeaks of Church-Officers, but of no She-Ones. And again, Chap 14. v. 34. He is plain in the Caſe, <hi>Let the Woman keep Silence in the Church, for it is not permitted to them to ſpeak;</hi> and ſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. Again, I think he is ſtrangely out, when he ſays, page 11. That there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Neceſſity for Publick Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſince we can read the Goſpel at home; for I am really a Friend to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Creed, and believe the Communion of Saints, which is an Article founded on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture, as well as the other Articles of that Creed, and which muſt be had by joining to ſome Church or Congregation, ſuch as is deſcribed in the 19th Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But indeed, if you ſpeak of National, or Provincial Churches, which diſtinguiſh themſelves by their own, or other Mens Inventions; I am of the Mind of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who would not be a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>Athens,</hi> becauſe they required ſome ſeparating Ceremonies, whereas, He took himſelf to be a Citizen of the World. A Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which the Pious and Ingenious Mr. <hi>Burſcough,</hi> in his late Diſcourſe of <hi>Schiſm</hi> has Cited; (but whether to this Purpoſe let the World Judge) I will not for the ſame Reaſon, confine my Communion to any ſuch Party, becauſe I am a Member of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95466:107"/>the <hi>Catholick-Church.</hi> But, for Ordinary Communion, certainly every Chriſtian ought to be a Member of ſome Congregation, if he can ſo be, and that which Conſiſts of his Neighbours is moſt Agreeable to the Ends of Chriſtian Communion. And, then as to Church Officers, the Bible is Plain; the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Apoſtles <hi>Paul,</hi> are full of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Biſhops, Presbyters and Deacons; He left <hi>Tinus</hi> in <hi>Creet,</hi> to Ordain Presbyters in every City, <hi>Tit.</hi> 5. and 4.4 <hi>Eph.</hi> 11. He tells us, that our Saviour gave ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the Perfecting of the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Words are all Maſculine, and no Place Mentions a ſhe Apoſtle or Evangeliſt. But, here let the Clergy obſerve the Conſequence of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Unſcriptural Rights, <hi>jure Divino,</hi> which drives Men to Queſtion, whether they have any at all.

And I cannot but Obſerve, that this Paſſage in this Second Epiſtle, (which was Written about Eleven Years after the Firſt) ſeems to fall from that inſpired Writer, to prevent the Miſtake that Men might be led into, by that other Text in the firſt Epiſtle, and at the ſame time Inſinuate, that in Ordination, the Biſhop and Presbyters (where a Church has both) do beſt together, ſo the ſame Apoſtle in his Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains ſome Paſſages in his firſt, as alſo ſome Things in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that occaſioned Miſtakes, are ſet right in the Second.</p>

But if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> be in the right, both the Biſhops and Presbyters were Biſhops of the Holy Ghoſts making, <hi>i. e.

                  <p>Surely Mr. <hi>Maurice</hi> had as good let that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, and have wholly ſlid away from the Objection, as he does in another Place; for Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> making it his great Argument againſt <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy,</hi> that it was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impracticable, ſuppoſing the Biſhop the ſole Paſtor of the Dioceſs, conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches, <hi>Pag.</hi> 226. and proving it ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably from Reaſon, and the Teſtimony of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and others, and having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Gregory, Orat.</hi> 20. who Applauds the Multiplying of Biſhopricks as an Excellent Art. Souls being hereby better lookt after; he Obſerves, that others would have this leſs regarded, and the Biſhops Honour more: Now, what does Mr. <hi>Maurice</hi> ſay to all this; why in Truth, juſt nothing at all? St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> ſays, that a Biſhop at the Peril of his Soul, is to take exact Notice of the Spiritual State of all under his Charge, and conſtantly to perform all Paſtoral Duties to the whole Flock; he had need of many Thouſand
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95466:109"/>Eyes, to look into the State of every Soul under him, which of them can Digeſt bitter Remedies, and who for want of them grow Careleſs. Tho' he Order his own Life well, if he does not exactly take Care of thee, and of all that are under him, to Hell he goes with the Wicked. And in another Place, it is very Burdenſom to have the Charge of 150 Souls. Now, what is to be done? Theſe Matters are Plain. If a Biſhop be the ſole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of 500000, and ſome of them live 3000 Miles from the Biſhops Pallace; as for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the diſtance of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> from <hi>Fulham,</hi> how is <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to be anſwered? Why, even by denying what he ſays. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſays Mr. <hi>Maurice, Pag.</hi> 438. <q>are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly accountable for thoſe who Periſh by their Neglect of their proper Office; but will not be Condemned for not doing the Office of a Presbyter, to all the Particulars of his Dioceſs.</q> But pray, what is the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Presbyter, if thoſe Paſſages of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> do not deſcribe it. It were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Honeſter to ſay, the Biſhop is the Preſident of the Presbytery, and not the ſole Paſtor of the Dioceſs; he may have the Care of Souls in one particular Pariſh, but every Pariſh Presbyter is a Biſhop of his Pariſh; and as ſuch, thoſe Paſſages of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him, and not the <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> who by the 71 Canon of the <hi>African Code,</hi> is forbidden
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95466:110"/>to leave his Cathedral Church, and go to any other Church in his Dioceſs to reſide there. This would be Plain Dealing, and a better Anſwer to the Charge of conſulting the Biſhops Honour, more than the good of Souls, than to tell the Story of the <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> whoſe Blood poiſon'd a Viper that bit him. <hi>Def.</hi> of <hi>Di.

For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the Pains that Ingenious Independent has taken, Dioceſan-Epiſcopacy rightly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is too hard for him; but taking the Dioceſan as the Sole Paſtor of a Dioceſs, theſe Two Gentlemen do moſt manifeſtly Confute one another, and neither of them in Truth, are for the True Primitive Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. That <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> in this Sence, which I give of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Epiſcopacy, is very conſiſtent with the aforeſaid Paſſages, and his Practice does no more Contradict his Doctrine, then Dr. <hi>

                  <p>I ſee no way of ſaving the Souls of either of Biſhop or People without Diſcipline; I ſee no Poſſibility of Diſcipline, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing many Paſtors in every Dioceſs, (too big for the Inſpection of a ſingle Paſtor) who
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95466:110"/>have the Power of the Keys, and I do not diminiſh here by the Dioceſans Grandure, unleſs it be Claimed by the Inſtitution of Chriſt, who has forbid ſuch a Claim in the moſt Expreſs Terms, and told us his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this World, neither He nor His Apoſtles would meddle with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and altho' I think the 13th <hi>Rom.</hi> which has been much urged for Arbitrary Power, and unlimitted Submiſſion to the worſt of Rulers ſignifies no ſuch thing, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially being Written in <hi>Neros Quinquenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> when his Reign was ſuitable to, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Deſcription of it, in that Chapter: Yet that, and many ſuch Texts ſhew, that the Apoſtles thought not of any ſuch Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Divine Inſtitution, as the High Party pretend to; it is not the Buſineſs of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel to meddle with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, other than Paſtoral, at leaſt till the Apoſtles ſhall ſit on Thrones, judging the 12 Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and when that will be, God only knows. But of this I am ſure, that there have been many Heretical Councils, that the Councils of <hi>Rome</hi> held by <hi>Gregory</hi> the III. in the 8th Century, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 903 Biſhops, almoſt Thrice the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Fathers at the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> Decreed the Worſhipping of Images, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the Emperor <hi>Leo,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his Imperial Dignity, for Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95466:111"/>Images. And whereas the Councils of <hi>Nice</hi> in the 4th Century, appointed 3 Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, one in <hi>Rome,</hi> another in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Third in <hi>Antioch,</hi> with Power to Convocate within their own Bounds, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Councils for timely ſuppreſſing of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, this was ſo far from ſuppreſſing them, that many of thoſe Patriarchs were moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Hereticks, and the great Promoters of Hereſy, <hi>Eulalius, Euphronius, Placitus, Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Leontius, Spado, Eudoxius,</hi> all Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch</hi> were Arians in the very ſame Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So was <hi>Lucius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And tho' <hi>Julius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Rome,</hi> and moſt of his Succeſſors in that Age, were a Refuge to the Orthodox; yer, <hi>Siricius</hi> in that Age, forbad Marriage to Prieſts, and their affecting Supremacy, was very Viſible. And Liberius one of them is given up by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an Arian, and theſe Pretences at laſt, iſſued in the <hi>Papal-Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet, in ſhort, I know no Reaſon why a Miniſter of the Goſpel, may not be made by the Civil Government a Lord of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor why, a Lord of Parliament may not become a Miniſter of the Goſpel. It were no Diſparagement to the Emperor, to be an Embaſſador for Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And I was pleaſed with a Story that I heard of, a certain Clergy-Man, on whom an Earldom deſcended, who Wrote himſelf Miniſter of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95466:111"/>Jeſus Chriſt, and Earl of <hi>K. He that receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them receiveth Chriſt, and he that receiveth Him, receiveth Him that ſent Him.</hi> I have the ſame Expectations with the Author of <hi>the Caſe of the Regale,</hi> that many of the Promiſes of the Glory of the Church, muſt be fulfilled in this World; that there are Original, Fundamental and Divine Powers, with which Chriſt has inveſted His Church; that there is a Diſcipline which Chriſt has left in his Church, and which is abſolutely neceſſary, with which Princes cannot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, and which they may not Over-rule; that ſhe has an Original Independance from all Kings and States, who ought to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to her Diſcipline, if they Profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Members of her; that Cenſures are ſtill in her Power, and that ſhe cannot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from them; and that they would ſtill have their Effect upon all truly Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and reſtore the now well nigh loſt Notions of a Church and Religion; but then, all theſe things muſt be found in the Bible; and Men may as well make an Act to Burn the Bible, <hi>Preſ. Pag.</hi> 23. as ſet Up for Rights, Powers and Priviledges, <hi>Jure Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> which are not to be found there.</p>
                  <p>He is certainly in the right <hi>Pag.</hi> 25. that nothing can be believed to be Religion by any People, but what they think to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and they can think nothing can be ſo,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95466:112"/>that is in the Power of Man to alter or Tranſverſe. I look on every True Goſpel Miniſter, as repreſenting the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, and Reverence Him as His Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; but I have his Inſtructions in my Hand, and he muſt not expect that I ſhew any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Demands, beyond thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Suppoſe a Treaty of Peace between the Emperor and the <hi>Hungaeians</hi> now in Arms, who Accept of the Terms offered them by His <hi>Imperial</hi> Majeſty; but, Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> would have Two or Three of his own Fancies complyed with, or no Peace ſhould be, would not the <hi>Hungarians</hi> think him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Impertinent and Saucy, would not the Emperor think Himſelf ill Served by him, and would not all the World think him ſtark Mad? The Application is eaſie. And here Sir, I could particularly ſhew you, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropos</hi> and his Wife did gradually Rob the Laity of their Reaſon, the Bible of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by what Degrees Prieſt-craſt grew, and Chriſtianity decayed, but I muſt not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large, having been much longer on this Head than I deſigned. But, I cannot Omit to give you, a Copy of a Letter Written by Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> to the <hi>Pope;</hi> when we of the Laity began to ſhake our Ears, and look about Us as you may find it, <hi>Ld. Herb. Hiſt. H.</hi> VIII. No. 2.</p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:95466:112"/>
                  <p>And now Sir <hi>Humphry,</hi> what is there in all this that hinders; but that you a High <hi>Church-Man,</hi> and I an <hi>Occaſional-Conformiſt,</hi> or rather if you pleaſe, an <hi>Occaſional-Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> are not of Oppoſite Principles, but of the ſame Perſwaſion in Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is there any particular Part of Religion, in what I have Diſcourſt under this Head, in which Conſideration, you do not fully agree with me in all Reſpects. Sure you cannot ſtill think either <hi>Engliſh-Prelacy,</hi> or <hi>Scotch-Presbytery, Jure Divino,</hi> tho' by the Civil Sanction, they be juſtifyed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Kingdoms, where they are Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. T'is a wonderful Thing, conſidering, for how many Ages Prelacy prevailed in the World, and the many Forgeries of Pieces of Antiquities, and the <hi>Indices Expurgatoriae</hi> that have been made, that there are ſo many Things to be ſaid againſt <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> out of Antiquity; and on the other ſide, 'tis wonderful, that if Presbyterian Government without a Preſident Biſhop had been <hi>Jure Divino</hi> that ſo Early, as the Year 140. it ſhould be Decreed over all the World, to change it to Dioceſan-Epiſcopacy, which the Presbyterians indeavour to Prove out of St. <hi>Jerom;</hi> and that in no Age ſince, till of late, the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of it ſhould be Diſcovered. And I believe, it may be proved, that the <hi>Albegois</hi> and <hi>Vaudois</hi> Churches, which have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95466:113"/>been pure Churches from the Apoſtles Days; have always allowed of Preſident Biſhops, tho' not of Dioceſans, being ſole Paſtors of a Dioceſs, <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> But, this Queſtion is no matter of either Natural or Revealed Religion; and therefore hinders me not, to Conclude, that you and I are not of Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Principles, but of one and the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in Matters of Religion; eſpecially, ſince we are both Members alſo of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, heartily Approve of the Laws of the Land, and cheerfully pay Obedience to them; tho' both you and I, would be Glad to ſee them altered, ſo as to reſtore Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, to Eſtabliſh the Church of <hi>England</hi> more firmly, to make a better Proviſion for the ſmall Vicarages and Curacys; to Unite our Differences and heal our Breaches, to Provide for Employing the Poor, to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Vice and Immorality more Effectually, and to promote Chriſtian Knowledge, both at Home and Abroad.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And having been too Prolix, tho' far from Impoveriſhing the Subject of the firſt Queſtion; I ſhall be ſhort in my Anſwer to the other; and as to the <hi>Second,</hi> Whether if the Occaſional-Bill had paſt, it had ſecured the Government from ſuch, who are not ſincere Members of the National Church, nor heartily approve of the Laws of the Land, nor chearfully pay Obedience to them; but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95466:113"/>are of Oppoſite Prinnciples, and not of one and the ſame Perſwaſion in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>I will only ſay, That 'tis plain, that altho' the Bill had paſſed, <hi>Atheiſts, Deiſts, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> thoſe that Value no Religion, nor any Church, if wiſe enough to avoid the late Act againſt Blaſphemy, Adulterers, Common Swearers, Extortioners, and all thoſe truly Scandalous <hi>Occaſional-Conformiſts,</hi> whoſe Lives ſhew, that they neither heartily Approve of the Laws of God, or of the Land; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chearfully nor otherwiſe, pay Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, would be Capable of Publick Offices and Employments, relating to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment either in Countries or Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, notwithſtanding that Bill, and would have been no way Affected by it; a Perſon of Sober Life, that had been in 5 or 6 Years, 5 or 600 Times at Church, and frequently received the Sacrament according to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> might have been removed out of an Office, tho' he had alſo all that while, laboured in doing Service to the Church, as by Law Eſtabliſh'd, which will be of Everlaſting Advantage to it; and a Perſon of a Proſligate Life, who had Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly owned, that he had not been at Church for as many Years, might be Capable of a <hi>Wh. St.—f.</hi> notwithſtanding that Act; but this is ſo Clear, That it needs no Proof, as to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95466:114"/>ſo much of this Queſtion, as relates to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and if you intend any other Laws, the <hi>Defacto</hi> Men, ſuch as believe the <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of Abſolute Monarchy, that take the Oaths to Her Majeſty as an Aſs eats Thiſtles, that neither heartily Approve of the Laws of the Land, abjuring the pretended <hi>James</hi> the III. and Eſtabliſhing Her Majeſty's Throne, and the Proteſtant Succeſſion, nor the Law for Toleration, nor chearfully pay Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, would be all unaffected by this Bill; ſurely the Promoters of it, thought there was no Sin, but going to a Proteſtant Meeting, as one of the Characters in <hi>Timon</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> thought there was no Sin but Murder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the Adminiſtration of Publick Aflairs may not be in the Hands of Perſons who are not of one and the ſame Perſwaſion in Matters of Religion, nay, of Men of oppoſite Principles, without Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or tearing the Government in pieces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and whether they may not, notwithſtanding, draw together the ſame way for the Publick Good. Now certainly, <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians, High-Church</hi> and <hi>Low-Church, Sherlockians</hi> and <hi>Southians,</hi> ſuch as take the Articles of the Church to be Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, and ſuch as take them only to be Articles of Peace; ſuch as are for the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional-Bill,</hi> and ſuch as are not, ſuch as hold the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and ſuch as do
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95466:114"/>not, are not of one and the ſame Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Matters of Religion, but of oppoſite Principles; and yet Sir <hi>Humphrey,</hi> you will not deny, that they may be all employ'd without Confuſion or tearing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in pieces between them; and may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding draw together the ſame way, for the Publick Good: but the truth is this,<note place="margin">Queens Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sermon, <hi>p. 24.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <q>Mixing of Heaven &amp; Earth together, as his Grace the Lord Arch-biſhop of <hi>York</hi> expreſſes it, When Men for difference of Opinion, about the Methods of the publick Conduct, break out into Parties and Factions, ſacrifice the Peace of the Kingdom to their own private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, and mingle Heaven and Earth for the ſupporting of a Side.</q> 'Tis this which tears the Government in pieces. It were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſirable, that all the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were good Chriſtians, for the ſake of the Publick and of their own Souls; for that Chriſtianity gives the beſt Rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt is the only Name under Heaven, given among Men, whereby they can be Saved: Yet Faith is the Gift of God, and Men may be of great Uſe in this World, who may be very unhappy in the next.</p>
                  <p>It is a Notion long ſince exploded, That Dominion is founded in Grace: and Honeſty, Honour, Skill, and Imegrity, may conſiſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95466:115"/>with a miſtaken Belief as to revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and in this reſpect no Religion but the Popiſh, or the High-Church Party in <hi>England,</hi> or the High-Kirk Party or Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> can make a Man other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe honeſt to tear the Government in pieces. Indeed Popery is inconſiſtent with Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to all Proteſtant Kings and States: For as <hi>Antonius de Dominis</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Spolato</hi> acknowledged above 80 years ago, The Church under the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is no more a Church but a human Government under the Monarchy of the Pope, which is wholly Temporal. And this Aſſertion of his may be eaſily juſtified out of the <hi>Lateran</hi> and other Councils, and their moſt celebrated Writers. So <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> tells us, That the Pope is as much above Biſhops as Biſhops are above Kings and Princes; that the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power is ſubjected to the Spiritual, as the Body to the Soul; and that therefore 'tis no Uſurpation when a Prelate meddles with Temporal Matters. So <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, about the Year 1274 affirms, That the Pope may depoſe Princes; and this after <hi>Edwardus Salburgenſis,</hi> in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Diet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> about the Year 1248, had thus expreſs'd himſelf: <q>There are now 175 Years elaſps'd ſince <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th laid the Foundations of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, under the ſhew of Religion, which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95466:115"/>in the ſame Oration he calls the Empire of Antichriſt.</q> But this is a matter ſo plain, that it cannot be denied by any learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant; and I wiſh that none who bear the Proteſtant Name were of the Mind of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> who teaches, that as well the Prieſtly as the Kingly Power is placed in the Paſtors of the Church, that ſo Chriſt may reign for ever: For 'tis not long ſince the Judges of <hi>England</hi> were ſolemuly told in a Sermon, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a mix'd Perſon. Alas theſe, and ſuch as theſe are the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which work Confuſion, and tear the Government in pieces; whether they got into the Heads of Prelatiſts or Presbyterians, or of Men of any other denomination: But altho' the Chriſtian Profeſſion with a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Converſation, ought to be look't upon as an excellent Qualiſication for an Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the Perſon has other Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proper for ſuch an Imployment, and ſuch a Man is certainly preferable to another of equal Skill, who either makes no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, or lives not according to his Profeſſion: Yet the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Honeſty with the <hi>Roman</hi> Courage, Loyalty, and Love to his Country, and largeneſs of Soul may render a Man more ſit for an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than a Selfiſh, Perſecuting, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, Arbitrary, narrow Soul Fellow, that oves none but his own Party, tho' he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95466:116"/>his Creed never ſo firmly, and roar'd for the Church never ſo boiſterouſly; and much more if all the noiſe he makes be for humane Inventions and Ceremonies. The Prieſts are now competently aſhamed of the pretended <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of abſolute Monarchy, and when they have been ſcouted out of all their Pretences under all Forms, to any <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> not to be found in the Scriptures: Then, and not till then will the Princes and States of Chriſtendom be ſecure and quiet.</p>
                  <p>The proof hereof would be too prolix, but I can't forbear to preſent you with a ſmall ſample. The Pope in the 13th Century ſent the Chriſtian Princes a Pilgrimage to recover the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> which was in truth only to take an Opportunity to uſurp upon their Rights in their Abſence, and to ſet up his pretended <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> to be Monarch of the World. Thus after <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9th had by Excommunication forc'd the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Frederick the Second</hi> to an Expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> he invaded <hi>Naples,</hi> and other parts of the Emperor's Dominions, and ſtirred up <hi>Henry,</hi> the Emperor's Son to Rebellion, and called a Council to depoſe him: Nor would he make Peace with him, tho' he ſued to the Pope for it; and tho' the <hi>Tartars</hi> carried all before them, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror could not obtain Liberty to aſſiſt the Chriſtians, but was forc'd to fight it out
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95466:116"/>with the Pope, till the Anti-chriſtian Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter having the worſt on't broke his Heart. Some time after Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4th bleſſed the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> about the Year 1248, and ſent him on the ſame Errand; but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a Council at <hi>Lyons</hi> againſt <hi>Frederick,</hi> and thereby hindred him from aſſiſting <hi>Lewis,</hi> who ſought to make Peace between the Emperor and the Pope, that he might be aſſiſted; but the barbarous Pope, and his pretended <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> left the poor King and his two Brothers Captives to the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi> and the whole Chriſtian Army to be cut off. Some time after Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 10th engaged the Emperor <hi>Rodulph</hi> to ſend an Army into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and after the Ruin of that Army, and the Captivity of the Prince of <hi>Meckleburg</hi> who commanded it, being the 7th Army in this Century that was ſent on the Pope's Errand: It happen'd that <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi> turned Chriſtian, and conquered <hi>Syria</hi> from the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and left Governors in it with expreſs Orders, that they ſhould enter into a Confederacy with the Chriſtian Princes of the <hi>Weſt:</hi> But Pope <hi>Boniſuce the Eighth,</hi> to whom this Offer was made, was ſo buſy in maintaining his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Philip,</hi> whom he Excommunicated and his Poſterity to the Fourth Generation, that he wholly ſlighted this Offer, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95466:117"/>oned the loſs of <hi>Syria,</hi> made <hi>Capeacus</hi> who governed in <hi>Damaſcus</hi> for <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt to the Soldan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the riſe of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire in the beginning of the next Age.</p>
                  <p>Alaſs, Sir, were there no Princes in the Seventeenth Century, ruined by Conteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe <hi>Jus Divinums?</hi> I pray God the Eighteenth Century may afford no inſtances of any Prince undone by believing the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Prieſtcraft. Theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it is not ſtrange that the National Synod or Council of <hi>Gap, Anno</hi> 1604, juſt 100 Years ago, for the Reaſons in their Acts mentioned; and among others, for that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with relation to Civil Affairs, tramples on the lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Magiſtrates, giving, taking away, transferring Kingdoms; thus reſolve, <q>We Believe and Aſſert, that he is the true and proper Antichriſt, the Son of Perdition, foretold in the Word of God, the Purple Whore that ſits on the Seven Mountains in the Great City, that has obtained Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the Kings of the Earth, and we wait till God (as he hath promis'd, and already begun to do) ſhall break and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer him by the Spirit of his Mouth, and deſtroy him utterly by the brightneſs of his Coming.</q> But we are aſſured by a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95466:117"/>more infallible Authority, that the Kings of the Earth ſhall hate the Whore and make her Deſolate and Naked,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12, 16.</note> and eat her Fleſh, and burn her with Fire. The Kings, and not the Prieſts are to work this Reformation; and therefore tho' they had given their Power, Strength,<note place="margin">Verſe <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> and Kingdom to the Beaſt, which the Kings of the Earth never gave to any but the Pope and his Church; yet by re-aſſuming their reſpective Rights, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting their juſt Supremacy, God will ſome time or other utterly root out Prieſtcraft;<note place="margin">Revel. <hi>11.15.</hi>
                     </note> the Kingdoms of this World muſt become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt; not by turning Kingdoms into Churches and Kings into Prieſts, or ſetting up <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Imperio.</hi> Our Saviour at firſt indeed appeared to St. <hi>John</hi> in the Habit of a Prieſt, and his Sword went out of his Mouth, a plain Repreſentation how his Goſpel ſhould at firſt prevail: But after that <hi>Anthropos</hi> and <hi>Eccleſia</hi> had ſet up Antichriſt, and the Kings of the Earth had been a long time committing Fornication with the Great Whore,<note place="margin">Revel. <hi>18.3.</hi>
                     </note> and the inhabiters of the Earth had been made drunk with the Wine of her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, when <hi>Babylon</hi> is to fall; when the

                     </note> he then appears as a General in the Head of an Army; and tho' the Sword ſtill comes out of his Mouth, and his Name is called the <hi>Word of God,</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95466:119"/>ſupport the Queen and all other Sovereigns therein, that ſo the Chriſtian World may be quiet, then the Prieſts may enjoy the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our Saviour's Preſence, which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to their teaching all things whatſoever he has commanded, and we may have the Benefit of being ſo taught, otherwiſe many a good Chriſtian will be ready to ſay with poor <hi>Melancton,</hi> at his Death: I deſire to depart out of this Life for two Cauſes, that I may enjoy the deſired ſight of the Son of God, and the Church Triumphant, and that I may be delivered from the moſt barbarous and implacable hatred of Divines, and to believe that <hi>Eneas Sylvius</hi> was more infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when he pronounc'd, That all the Evil in the World either aroſe from Eccleſiaſtical Perſons,<note place="margin">Omne malum in Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do out exortum aviris Eccleſiaſticis aut ab illis patratum.</note> or had been perpetrated by them, than he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when about the Year 1458, he became Pope <hi>Pius the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi>

                  <p>Now as to ſo much of this Queſtion, as relates to the Teſt Act, I ſhall chooſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the Plea annext to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, No. 1. only adding, that ſince the Writing thereof, your Oracle in the ſame Place, where he Adviſes to the late Bill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Occaſional-Conformity,</hi> ſeems to give up the Point, as to that Part of the Teſt, that enjoins the actual Receiving of the Lords Supper, <hi>for Caſe of the Regale,</hi> Pag. 179. He ſinds Faults with Bribing Men to Prophane the Holy Sacrament for an Office, that an Action ſhould be againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who ſhould refuſe it to them, tho' he Knows, Sees, and Hears them in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations and Principles to be never ſo much Unqualified.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Corporation Act, 'tis plain, that there have been vaſt Alterations made in the Conſtitution of the Government, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, ſince the making of that Act, which may juſtly Occaſion a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95466:120"/>of that Act, without any Danger to the Government; eſpecially, if made by ſuch Perſons, as Her moſt Excellent Majeſty ſhall Commiſſionate for that Purpoſe; and in hope of living to ſee ſuch an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I have before mentioned; and ſuch a Commiſſion, I will ſay no more on that Subject.</p>
                  <p>And now methinks, the Fifth Queſtion is ſufficiently conſidered already, that Part of It, which relates to the Practice of other wiſe Nations, has been Effectually anſwered by other Hands, in the Examples of moſt Wiſe Nations, Heathen and Chriſtian; and I don't find any Reply is offered, except a dry Diſcourſe juſt come to Hand at the Writing of theſe Lines. Indeed Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry,</hi> I was comforting my Self with the thoughts of Subſcribing your humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, when I was Interrupted by the Noiſe of one <hi>J—S.</hi> who ſeems to be <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Style,</hi> in whoſe Name we Lawyers uſe to put Caſes, from whom I expected ſome mighty Matter, for Peace and Union are Excellent Things: But alas, 'tis a poor Creature, and I ſhall conſider him in a few Words. All the Chriſtian Acts of Moderation in other Countries, he takes to be Acts of Neceſſity, not of Choice. He ſeems to think, that there are no Laws in <hi>England,</hi> but thoſe of Uniformity, and the Corporation and Teſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95466:120"/>Acts, or otherwiſe he ſhamefully belies the Diſſenters; for, no Men are more fond of the other Laws of <hi>England,</hi> made for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Eſtabliſht Government. 'Tis a mighty Diſcovery that he has made, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would Repeal thoſe Laws. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no Man ever doubted it ſo far as concerns good Proteſtants, tho' it would be in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not a Repealing, but rectifying thoſe Laws. He has confirmed my Obſervation, that there is a ſtrange Byaſs on a certain Party of Men towards Popiſh and French Preſidents, or ſurely he would not have troubled the Reader with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of <hi>Portugal, Spain, Italy,</hi>

Let him take his Swing againſt all Parties, that would undermine our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but the things he and his Party are ſo fond of, are rather our Excrements, than our Conſtitution; and if only one thing is to be done at once,<note place="margin">Page. <hi>16.</hi>

                  <p>But leaſt the word <hi>Excrement</hi> ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, I think ſit to acquaint you, that I have it from that great Man &amp; eminent Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Dr. <hi>Henry Moor,</hi> who among his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains (which I have ſeen written with his own Hand) has this Paſſage, <q>That that which is good indeed ſhould be generally reliſhed by the World is as unlikely as that dead Men in their Graves ſhould call out for Drink; but when Goodneſs is revived in the World, that which now goes for Food and Delicacy ſhall then be left as Dung and Excrement.</q> I hope, Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry,</hi> that Goodneſs is reviving in the World, and I know that Sir <hi>Humphry Mackworth</hi> has his Heart and Hands engaged in its Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and you know that there are <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Conſormiſts,</hi> who join intirely with you therein. I was heartily ſorry to find your Name to a Diſcourſe which ſignifies to me, that you take that for Food and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, which I think deſerves the other Name. But there is another Paſſage among thoſe Remains in theſe words, <q>There is a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kind of Religiouſneſs, which is but the Stamp or Character of this or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's diſpoſition, ſome are given na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to the magnificence of outward Ceremonies; others do attend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  </opener>
                  <p>IT hath been one of the moſt ſucceſsful Stratagems of the Apoſtate Prince of Darkneſs, to ruin Mens Souls by thoſe very means which were ordained for their Salvation; and this Policy of his appears in no Inſtance more evident than in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods he has taken to make the Euchariſt a means of Deſtruction; while by unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Receiving,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 29.</note> Men Eat and Drink Damnation to themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:95466:125"/>
                  <p>Hence his faithful Servants, the Authors of that Myſtery of Iniquity, Popery, have made Tranſubſtantiation a Teſt of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiciſm, burning and damning Men for being Men; that is, for uſing their Senſe and Reaſon. With one hand robbing us of the Holy Sacrament and its proper uſes; and with the other preſenting us with a piece of Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry, and requiring our Adoration of a ſenſeleſs Idol.</p>
                  <p>The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was inſtituted by our Bleſſed Saviour, in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Himſelf, and as a Bond of Union among his Followers. 'Tis the peculiar Right of ſuch, who by ſound Faith, well digeſted Knowledge and ſome Experience of the Comforts and Pleaſures that reſult from a good Conſcience, and Holy Converſation, are made to long for further Degrees of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Will of God, clearer mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of the Divine Love, and more evident ſigns of the Souls recovery from its fallen State.</p>
                  <p>The Motives to come to it ought to be from within, or elſe from above, and not from beneath; and the things to be obtained by it ought to be increaſe of Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and not of outward Emoluments.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:95466:125"/>
                  <p>Bleſſed is that Nation where the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can find Men (otherwiſe fitted for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employments) whoſe uſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appears by their Converſations, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſuch Principles: And ſurely he who loves the Commemoration of the Prince of the Kings of the Earth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5.</note> in this way of his own Inſtitution, has an excellent Qualification to recommend him to thoſe Vice-gerents of that Prince, who deſire and deſign to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, to give a plain Anſwer to your Queſtion, I am of Opinion,</p>
                  <p>That it is at leaſt inconvenient to impoſe the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper on every Man that executes an Office in Publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, and that among others for theſe Reaſons,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Ordinance was inſtituted to other ends; and I know not when the Warrant was ſigned by our Saviour, to uſe it to ſuch a purpoſe: Tis his great Seal, and ought not to be put to any Commiſſions but his own.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:95466:126"/>
                  <p n="2">2. No Man who is fit for it, needs a Law to bring him to it.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3. If this Teſt be eſtabliſh'd, it is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all Men in their reſpective Places to keep from O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

And if the Government ſhould permit no Man to be in any Office that drinks to exceſs, or miſpends his time in Tipling, that uſes to ſwear in common Diſcourſe, or whoſe Life otherwiſe appears vitious, what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Places would be empty, which are now well filled for the Publick Intereſt? And yet what Cruelty would it be to any vicious Man, to put him under a Neceſſity of profaning the Sacrament, by putting him into Office: for it is moſt certain, that not only every Man that lives in the practice of any known Vice, but every Man that lives not in a daily endeavour to perform his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made in Baptiſm with the moſt Bleſſed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95466:126"/>Trinity, ought to keep far off from the Sacred Table.</p>
                  <p>I know it is objected, that all Men ought to be fit for the Sacrament, and that it will tend much to a good Life, that they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Neceſſity to receive it. But let Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſpeak; Mens Stomachs have ſcarce yet digeſted the Sacraments, which they have prophaned for ſome Years paſt, to keep their Places. Men have taken the Sacrament and betrayed their Country, and ruined their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Neighbours: Taken the Sacrament and introduced Popery: Taken the Sacrament and murdered Men by colour of Law: And who is there (of a Subject) among the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Grievances of the Nation, that took not the Sacrament to enable him ſo to be: Not to mention Perſons of a better Rank, how many Vintners, Ale-houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, and others of like Profeſſion, have purchaſed their Licences at the Hazard of their ſouls? And I dare appeal to all Men, to whom theſe Preſents ſhall come, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within their Knowledge any Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been wrought thereby. Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred have refuſed it for Conſcience ſake, for one prophane Perſon that has ſcrupled it. And who, and where is he whoſe Life hath been reformed by being under this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>

The Generations to come ſhall call them Bleſſed, who inſtead of forcing Men to the Sacrament, uſe all Means divinely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to make them fit for it. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Biſhops kept Men <hi>Catechumens</hi> for a long time, and admitted none to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments till they were approved and practical Chriſtians. And if the Inhabitants, and eſpecially the Children of <hi>England</hi> were every where made <hi>Catechumens</hi> by Publick Authority, the next Generation may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fill all Publick Employments with Men, who would approach the Sacrament both to the Publick Advantage and their own: For the Appearances of Divine Providence in the World are now conſpicuous, and at all times (but eſpecially in thoſe Days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is pleaſed more eminently to take to himſelf his great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Reign) good Men are Publick Bleſſings,<note place="margin">

I muſt confeſs it is difficult to me to find out any plauſible Reaſon for this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; ſure it is not worth a while to make ſuch a Teſt to ſecure a diſputable Poſture, or to tempt all Hypocrites into the Church; for 'tis Ten to One, that he that comes to the Sacrament becauſe he cannot have an Employment without it, is an Hypocrite: And it is as many to one, but the Proteſtant that loſes an Office, becauſe he cannot <hi>ſo</hi> receive the Sacrament, is an honeſt Man, is a true and uſeful Subject.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It cannot be an equivalent to the aforeſaid Dangers, that hereby ſome Papiſts may be kept from Employments; for he is greatly miſtaken, that believes the Sacrament to be the ſtrength of the Teſt. Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is the thing which the Papiſts cannot renounce, (for Men are fond of Gods of their own making) but he may well communicate with the Church, as by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95466:128"/>the Examples of the late King <hi>Charles the Second, Obadiah Walker,</hi> and others, is plainly evinced: And the Reaſon is as plain as the Fact; for he either believes, that we have no Goſpel Prieſts, and takes the Bread and the Wine as common Food: Or if he allows our Prieſts Power to conſecrate, he may adore the Bread very conveniently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Beſides, Papiſts in diſguiſe are no ways dreadful, when they have no Protection or Favour from Court. They have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſcovered in the ſhort time of Father <hi>Peter</hi>'s Miniſtry, and muſt never expect to live unknown or unhated in <hi>England</hi> any more; ſo that upon the whole matter the ſum of what I have offered is this</p>
                  <p>That to make the Sacrament a Teſt for Civil Offices, is unſuitable to the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Nature, and Ends of the Sacrament, dangerous to the Government, and to the Souls of Men, grounded on no ſolid Reaſon, of uſe only to exclude good Subjects, and wholly inſufficient to promote the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>England,</hi> which is by all means conſiſtent with Reaſon and Juſtice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Union among Proteſtants, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Popery for ever.</p>
